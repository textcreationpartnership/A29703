            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Dear Friends, many and great have been the breaches that the Lord hath made upon your perſons, upon your neer and dear Relations, and upon your ſweeteſt comforts and contentments: There is not one of you but may truly ſay with <hi>Job, He breaketh me with breach upon breach,</hi> Job. 16.
<pb facs="tcp:40722:3"/> 14. God hath chaſtiſed you all round with various Rods; and O that the Lord would help you all to hear the Rod, and him who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>Now that you may, give me leave a little to open and apply to your particulars that</p>
            <p>Mic. 6. 9.</p>
            <q>The Lords voyce cryeth unto the City, and the man of wiſdom ſhall hear thy Name: Hear ye the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</q>
            <p>The matter that I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to your conſideration from this Scripture, will be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſpecial concernment to your ſelves, but alſo of high concernment to all ſorts and ranks of men and women, in this ſad Day, when the <hi>Sword</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:4"/> devours on the one hand, &amp; the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> rageth on the other hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City. Tremelius</hi> turns it thus, <hi>The voice of the Lord doth preach unto this City (for what the matter is, thy Name ſeeth) Hear ye the Rod,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This City,</hi> viz. <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo conſequently to all the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi> for in this City all Offices and duties of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity were more religiouſly performed, or to be performed, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and majeſty of God that was amongſt them: <hi>But thy Majeſty ſeeth what wickedneſs is practiſed amongſt them,</hi> as is evident in the Verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cryeth,</hi> The word is from <hi>Kara,</hi> which ſignifies, Firſt,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:4"/> 
               <hi>To Cry aloud,</hi> or, <hi>to make a noiſe,</hi> Iſa. 58. 1. <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> there is <hi>Kara:</hi> The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>to Cry</hi> ſo loud, as that all may hear, that have ears to hear. Secondly, The word ſignifies, <hi>Openly to proclaim, preach, or publiſh a thing,</hi> Exod. 33. 19. <hi>I will Proclaim the Name of the Lord before thee:</hi> Here is the word <hi>Kara.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The word ſignifies, <hi>To Cry out,</hi> Gen. 39. 15. <hi>I lifted up my voyce and cryed:</hi> Here is <hi>Kara.</hi> The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath nine other ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Scripture; but becauſe they are not pertinent to what is in my eye, I ſhall paſs them by at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the man of Wiſdom ſhall ſee thy name. Vethuſhiia</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies <hi>Eſſence;</hi> and therefore according to the Hebrew, the words ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:40722:5"/> read thus, <hi>And the man of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhall ſee thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>he that is a man indeed, he that is not a ſot, aſtock, a ſtone.</hi> Moſt men are men of folly, and ſo not worthy of the name of men; but as for ſuch as are truly wiſe, they ſhall ſee thy Name. There is a great meaſure of ſpiritual Art, of Holy and Heavenly Wiſdome required, both to enable a man to hear the voice of the Rod, and to underſtand the language of the Rod: This Wiſdom is too high for a fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall ſee thy Name.</hi> Now the Hebrew word here uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be better derived from <hi>Jare,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>feare,</hi> than from <hi>Raah,</hi> that ſignifies to <hi>ſee,</hi> and ſo the words will run ſmoothly thus, <hi>The man of wiſdom, or of eſſence, ſhall fear</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:5"/> 
               <hi>thy Name,</hi> conſidering that, 'tis majeſty it ſelf that cryeth, and that he is immediately to deal with God himſelf, and not with a poor, weak, mortal worm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hear ye the Rod.</hi> The word <hi>Hear,</hi> is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Shamang,</hi> which ſignifies, Firſt, <hi>To mark, obſerve, and attend, to what is ſaid,</hi> Gen. 29. 33. <hi>The Lord hath heard that I was hated;</hi> that is, <hi>he hath marked it, he hath obſerved it.</hi> So here, O mark the Rod, O obſerve the Rod, O attend to what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Rod. Secondly, The word ſignifies, <hi>to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is ſpoken,</hi> ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 23. <hi>They knew not that Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph underſtood them:</hi> In the Hebrew 'tis, <hi>that Joſeph heard them.</hi> Now to hear the Rod, is to underſtand what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us by the Rod. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:6"/> The word ſignifies, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing reported to be true,</hi> ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>They hearkned not unto Moſes,</hi> that is, <hi>they did not believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that Moſes made. Hear the Rod,</hi> that is, <hi>believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Rod makes.</hi> The Rod reports, that of all evils, Sin is the greateſt evil; and that of all bitters, Sin is the greateſt bitter; O believe the report of the Rod. The Rod reports that God is angry, that God is diſpleaſed; Oh believe its report. The Rod reports the creatures to be meer vanity and vexation of Spirit; O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its report. The Rod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our neereſt and deareſt comforts, contentments, and enjoyments to be mixt, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and momentary; O believe its report. The Rod reports Sin to be vile, and the world to be
<pb facs="tcp:40722:6"/> vain, and Heaven to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Chriſt to be moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; O believe its report. The Hebrew word hath three other ſignifications, but being that they are not proper to our purpoſe I ſhall paſs them by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Rod.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Matte</hi> that is here rendred <hi>Rod,</hi> hath theſe three ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Firſt, It denotes <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 2. 9. <hi>A Rod of Iron.</hi> Secondly, It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes <hi>Rigid</hi> and <hi>harſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Iſa. 14. 5. <hi>The Lord hath broken the ſtaffe,</hi> or <hi>Rod of the wicked,</hi> that is, <hi>their rigorous and cruel Government. Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> ſorely afflicted the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> he was a Rod that brake them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ruled over them with much rigour in <hi>Babilon.</hi> Thirdly, It denotes <hi>ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:7"/> 
               <hi>and heavy Judgements,</hi> Pſal. 89. 32. <hi>I will viſit your tranſgreſſions with a Rod.</hi> And thus you are to underſtand the word <hi>Rod</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And him that hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</hi> 'Tis God that appoints the Rod, and ordaines it for the revenge of the quarrel of his Covenant. The Hebrew word <hi>Jegnadah</hi> ſignifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>to appoint,</hi> or <hi>conſtitute.</hi> 'Tis God who appoints the Rod, and who conſtitutes it to do what ſervice he pleaſeth. 'Tis God that hath not only a permiſſive, but alſo an active hand, in all the afflictions that come upon his People.</p>
            <p>And let thus much ſuffice for the opening of the words.</p>
            <p>Now though this choice Garden affords many ſweet Flowers, yet I ſhall only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with one, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:7"/> 
               <hi>That all the Afflictions, troubles, and tryals,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that God layes upon his People, are his Rod, and that 'tis their higheſt and greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to hear the voyce of the Rod, and to take out thoſe Leſſons that God would have them learn by the Rod.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>For the opening and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this important Point, I ſhall endeavour theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſhew you in what reſpects Afflictions are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Rod.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ſhew you what thoſe ſpecial Leſſons are, that you are to learn by the Rod.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects are afflictions like unto a Rod?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40722:8"/>
            <p> I Anſwer, In theſe ſeven reſpects Afflictions are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Rod.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Rod is never made uſe of, but when no fair means will prevail with the Child. 'Tis ſo here, God never takes up the Rod, he never afflicts his People, till he <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 15,<hi>—ult.</hi> Mat. 23. 37, 38.</note> hath tryed all fair wayes and means to humble them, and reform them: And when none of the offers of grace, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of mercy, the wooings of Chriſt, the ſtrivings of the Spirit, northe ſmart debates of Conſcience will awaken them, nor work upon them, then God takes up the Rod, and ſometimes whips them till the blood comes. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Parents chooſe what Rods they pleaſe to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Children with. The Child ſhall not chooſe what
<pb facs="tcp:40722:8"/> Rod he pleaſeth to be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, O no: 'Tis the prerogative of the Father to chooſe the Rod; the Father may chooſe and uſe either a great Rod or a little Rod, a long Rod or a ſhort Rod, a Rod made up of Roſemary branches, or a Rod made up of green Birch: 'Tis ſo here, God chooſeth what Rod, what Affliction he pleaſeth to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his people with. You <note place="margin">Lev. 26. Deut. 28. Lament. 3. 9,—18.</note> read in the Scripture of very many Rods, but they are all of Gods chooſing, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Is there any evil in the City and hath not the Lord done it?</hi> Though there be many Rods to be found in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet there is not one of them, but is of Gods chooſing, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>It grieveth me much for your ſakes, that the hand of the Lord is gone out</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:9"/> 
               <hi>againſt me.</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty; why then call ye me Naomi, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord hath teſtified againſt me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? Iſa.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>I form the light, and create dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I make peace and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things. Mic.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Maroth, waited carefully for good; but evil came down from the Lord unto the Gates of Jeruſalem. David</hi> was whipt with many Rods, <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 9. Job. 1</note> but they were all of Gods own chooſing. And <hi>Job</hi> was whipt with many Rods, but they were all of Gods own chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Parents take no pleaſure, they take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to uſe the Rod. Every laſh the Father gives the
<pb facs="tcp:40722:9"/> Child, fetches blood from his own heart: The Father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Child, and ſighs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Child; he whips the Child, and at the ſame time weeps over the Child. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing goes more againſt the Parents heart, nor againſt their hair, than the bringing of their Children under the Rod of Correction; 'Tis ſo here, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>For he doth not afflict willingly</hi> (or as the Hebrew runs, <hi>he doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> Millibbo, <hi>from his heart) nor grieve the Children of men.</hi> You often read, that he delights in mercy; but <note place="margin">Mich. 7. 15.</note> where do you once read, that he delights in ſeverity, or in dealing roughly with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? God very rarely takes <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 16. Jer. 5. 19.</note> up the Rod, but when our ſins have put a force upon him. 'Tis grievous to God, to
<pb facs="tcp:40722:10"/> be a grieving his People; 'tis a pain unto him, to be a puniſhing of them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi> My Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſaith God, calls upon me to rain Hell out of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, as once I did upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah;</hi> but then Mercy interpoſeth her four ſeveral hows, <hi>how, how, how, how, how ſhall I give thee up?</hi> God puts theſe four patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal interrogations to himſelf, becauſe none elſe in Heaven or Earth could anſwer them. The Prophet brings in God ſpeaking after the manner of men, who being provoked a thouſand thouſand wayes, by
<pb facs="tcp:40722:10"/> the vanities and follies of their Children, think to give them up to take their own courſes, and to look no more after them; but then their bowels begin to work, and their hearts begin to melt, and they begin to interrogate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus, <hi>How ſhall we give up theſe Children? for though they be diſobedient Children, yet they are Children; how can we turn them out of doores? how can we diſown them? how can we diſinherit them? for though they are rebellious Children, yet they are Children,</hi> &amp;c. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are called Gods work, yea, his ſtrange work; his <note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 21.</note> act, yea, his ſtrange act, as if God were out of his element, when he is afflicting or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing his People. But.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40722:11"/>
            <p> Fourthly, The Rod is ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grievous, and troubleſom; and ſo are afflictions to our natures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be joyous but grievous.</hi> Fleſh and blood ſtartles, and is troubled at the leaſt trouble. Affliction is a ſort of Phyſick, that makes moſt ſick. Some write that <hi>Tygres</hi> will grow mad, and tear their own fleſh, <note place="margin">Plutarch lib. de ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> and rend themſelves in piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if they do but hear Drums or Tabours ſound about them. Were not <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job. 3. Jer. 20.</note> ſuch <hi>Tygres,</hi> who in the day of their afflictions did more than curſe the Day of their birth? O what a bitter cup, what a heavy burden was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to them! <hi>Job</hi> 10. 1. <hi>My Soul is weary of my life. Job</hi> 7. 15. <hi>My Soul chooſeth ſtrangling and death rather</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:11"/> 
               <hi>than life. Pſal.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with my groaning. Pſal.</hi> 69. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my Soul. I ſink in deep mire, where there is no ſtanding. I am come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deep waters, where the floods overflow me. I am weary of my crying, my throat is dryed: mine eyes fail, while I wait for my God.</hi> Doubtleſs many good men have ſat under <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 4.</note> his <hi>Juniper,</hi> wiſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the World (if it might ſtand with Divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) that they might reſt from their ſins and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and be rid of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny burdens and bondages, looking upon life little better than a Hell, were it not for the hopes of a Heaven hereafter. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When Parents take up the Rod into their hands,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:12"/> they will not lay it down, till <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to was, <hi>(Omnia eoe voluntate Dei.) All muſt be as God will have it.</hi> And this ſhould be every Chriſtians Motto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod.</note> they have ſubdued the ſpirits of their Children, and brought them to ſubmit and to kiſs the Rod, and to ſit ſtill and quiet before them. 'Tis ſo here, when God takes up the Rod, he will not lay it down, till he hath brought us to lye quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his feet, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, 41, 42. <hi>If they ſhall confeſs their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their treſpas, which they have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and that alſo they have walked contrary to me; And that I alſo have walked contrary unto them, &amp; brought them into the Land of their enemies; if then their uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity, Then Will I remember my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Jacob, and alſo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:12"/> 
               <hi>my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham will I remember: and I will remember the Land.</hi> When God takes up the Rod, his Children muſt either bow or break; they muſt ſay, the <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 3, 6.</note> Lord is righteous, they muſt kiſs the Rod of Correction, or elſe deſtruction will come like a Whirle-wind upon them.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported of the Lyon, that he ſpares thoſe creatures, that fall down before him, and ſubmit unto him; but as for thoſe that endeavour to run from him, or to contend with him, thoſe he tears in pieces. 'Tis juſt ſo with the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as you may ſee in that <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> riding furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <note place="margin">Acts and Mon. in Edward I.</note> after a ſervant of his,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:13"/> that had highly diſpleaſed him, with a drawn Sword in his hand as purpoſing to kill him; ſeeing him ſubmit, and on bended knee ſuing for his life, did not only put up his Sword, but alſo ſpared him, and received him into his favour. The King of Kings will never put up his ſword when once he hath drawn it, till his People fall on their knees, &amp; ſubmit unto him. God never left chaſtiſing of <hi>Ephraim</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20.</note> till he had brought him to his bow, till he had made him ſubmit and kiſs the Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Afflictions are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Rod, in reſpect of the hand that layes them on. Though Affliction be a Rod, it is a Rod in a Fathers hand. <note place="margin">John 18. 11.</note> The Sword is in the Judges hand, and the Cudgel is in the Maſters hand, but the Rod is in the fathers hand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
<pb facs="tcp:40722:13"/> 6, 7, 8, 9. When <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs <note place="margin">Num. 22. 29.</note> offended him, he wiſhed for a ſword to ſlay him: But ſo doth not God; when we doe moſt highly provoke him, he doth not take up a Sword to ſlay us, but only a Rod to ſcourge us and chaſtiſe us, as indulgent Fathers do their deareſt Children. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly and Laſtly, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are called a Rod, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ends to which they ſerve. A Rod is not to kill, but to cure; 'tis not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but for correction. When <hi>David</hi> gave a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Souldiers againſt <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 'Twas not to ſlay him, but to reſtrain him; 'twas not to ruine him, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to his former obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Application is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. We can as well live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our daily bread, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:40722:14"/> our dayly Rod. Now the ends of taking up the Rod are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt and more generally, 'Tis for the good of the child, and not for his hurt: 'Tis ſo here, God takes up the Rod, but 'tis for the good of his People, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>But as for you, ye thought evil againſt me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs, as it is this day, to ſave much people alive.</hi> Divine goodneſs did ſo over-maſter the plotted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, as that it made a bleſſed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of a moſt deadly poyſon. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord the God of Iſrael, like theſe good Figs, ſo will I acknowledg them that are carried away Captive of Judah, whom I have ſent out of this place, into the Land of the Chaldeans for their</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:14"/> 
               <hi>good.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 'Twas with <note place="margin">Exod. 11.</note> Gold and Ear-rings. And when <hi>Judah</hi> was diſmiſſed out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> 'twas with great gifts, Jewels, and all neceſſary Utenſils. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>And</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezra 1.</note> 
               <hi>we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the Called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> This Text like <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tree, caſt into the bitter waters of Affliction, may make them ſweet and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to drink of. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, The Rod is to make the Child ſenſible of his folly and vanity, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>In the lips of him that hath underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſdom is found: but the Rod is for the back of him that is void of underſtanding.</hi> So 'tis here, God takes up the
<pb facs="tcp:40722:15"/> Rod, but 'tis to make his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſenſible of their folly and vanity, 'tis to make them look up to him, and to look into Conſcience, and to look out to their Converſations. <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Crucis,</hi> is <hi>Schola Lucis.</hi> Gods houſe of correction is his ſchool of inſtruction; his laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are our leſſons, his ſcourges are our School-maſters, and his chaſtiſements are our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 9. Pſal. 94. 12 Pro. 3. 12, 13. Job. 36. 8, 9, 10.</note> Hence both the Hebrews and Greeks expreſs <hi>chaſtening</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> by one and the ſame word <hi>(Muſar Paideia)</hi> becauſe the latter is the true end of the former, according to that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Smart makes Wit, and vexation gives underſtanding.</hi> Afflictions are a Chriſtians Looking-Glaſs, by which he may ſee how to dreſs his own <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oculos quos peccatum claudit, paena appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Greg. <hi>The eye that ſin ſhuts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</hi>
               </note> Soul, and to mend whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:40722:15"/> is amiſs: They are Pills made up by a heavenly hand, on purpoſe to clear our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 18. <hi>And ſhe ſaid unto Elijah, what have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my ſin to remembrance, and to ſlay my Son?</hi> If God had not taken away her Son, her ſin had not been brought to remembrance. It was the Speech of an holy man in his ſickneſs, <hi>In this Diſeaſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have learned how great God is, and what the evil of ſin is; I never knew to purpoſe, what God was before, nor what ſin was before.</hi> The Croſs opens mens eyes, as the taſting of Honey did <hi>Jonathans. Here</hi> (as that Martyr phraſed it) <hi>we are ſtill a learning our A B C, and our leſſon is never paſt Chriſts Croſs, and our walking</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:16"/> 
               <hi>is ſtill home by weeping Croſs.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Rod is uſed to prevent further folly, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and miſery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 13, 14, <hi>With-hold not correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Child; for if thou beateſt him with the Rod, he ſhall not die. Thou ſhalt beat him with the Rod, and ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Soul from Hell.</hi> It is ſaid of the Ape, that ſhe hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her young ones to death, ſo many fond Parents by not correcting their Children, they come to ſlay their Children. The beſt way to prevent their being ſcourged with Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Hell, is to chaſtiſe them with the Rod here: So God takes up the Rod, he afflicts and chaſtiſeth his deareſt Children, but 'tis to prevent ſoul-miſchief and miſery, 'tis to prevent pride, ſelf-love,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:16"/> worldlineſs, <hi>&amp;c. Paul</hi> was <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9.</note> one of the holieſt men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lived on earth, he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome, an earthly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and yet he needed the Rod, he needed a thorn in the fleſh to prevent pride, witneſs the doubling of thoſe words in one verſe, <hi>leaſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, leaſt I ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> had not been buffetted, who knows how highly he might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in his own conceit? Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Phyſitians do often give their Patients Phyſick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Diſeaſes; &amp; ſo doth the Phyſitian of ſouls by his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Servants, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 17, 19. <note place="margin">Job 40. 4, 5. Hoſ. 2. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>He is chaſtened alſo with pain upon his bed, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his bones with ſtrong pain. That he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:17"/> 
               <hi>pride from man.</hi> Afflictions are the Lords Drawing-Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by which he draws out the core of pride, earthlineſs, ſelf-love, covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pride was one of mans firſt ſins, and is ſtill the root and ſource of all other ſins. Now to prevent it, God many times chaſtens man with pain, yea, with ſtrong pain upon his bed, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> The burnt Child dreads the fire. Sin is but a bitter ſweet; 'tis an evil worſe than Hell it ſelf. Look as Salt brine preſerves things from, putrefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; as ſalt Marſhes keep the Sheep from rotting; ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Rods, ſanctified Afflictions,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:17"/> preſerves and keeps the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God from ſinning. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Rod is to purge out that vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is bound up in the heart of the Child, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 15 <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a Child, but the Rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall drive it far from him.</hi> The Rod is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well as the Word; and ſuch Parents that uſe it as an Ordinance (praying and weeping over it) ſhall find it effectual, for the chaſing away of evil out of their Childrens heart. <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were two very choice men, and yet by their fondneſs on one hand, and neglect of this Ordinance on the other hand, they rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ſons, and whether they did not undo their ſouls, I ſhall not at this time ſtand to
<pb facs="tcp:40722:18"/> enquire. When <hi>Moſes</hi> caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Rod, it became a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 3.</note> and ſo when Parents caſt away the Rod of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 'tis ten to one but that their Children become the brood of the Serpent. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>He that ſpareth his Rod hateth his ſon; but he that loveth him chaſteneth him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi> Not only the care, but alſo the cure of the Child, ſo far as the Rod will reach, lyes upon the hands of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>Now Afflictions are like a Rod in this reſpect alſo, for as they are ſanctified, they cleanſ and purge away the droſs, the filth, and the ſcumb of the daughter of <hi>Zion, Iſa.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy droſs, and take away all thy tinn. Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:18"/> 
               <hi>iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin. Dan.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>And ſome of them of underſtanding ſhall fall</hi> (that is, <hi>into great Afflictions) to try them, and to purge them, and to make them white, even to the time of the end.</hi> All the harm the <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 23, 24.</note> fire did the three Children (or rather the three Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) was to burn off their cords. Our luſts are cords of vanity, but the fire of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall burn them up. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as Silver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tryed: they ſhall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will ſay, it is my People, and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God.</hi> Sharp Afflictions are a fire to purge out our droſs, and
<pb facs="tcp:40722:19"/> to make our graces ſhine; they are a potion to carry away ill humours, they are cold froſts to deſtroy the vermine, they are a tempeſtuous Sen, to purge the Wine from its lees; they are like the North Wind, that dryeth up the vapours, that purgeth the blood, and quickens the ſpirits; they are a ſharp Corroſive to eat out the dead fleſh. Afflictions are compared to Baptizing and waſhing, that takes away the filth of the Soul, as water doth the filth of the body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 38, 39. God would not rub ſo hard, were it not to fetch out the dirt and ſpots that be in his Peoples hearts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Rod ſerves to improve that good that is in the Child, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 15. <hi>The Rod and reproof giveth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but a Child left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:19"/> 
               <hi>bringeth his Mother to ſhame.</hi> So Afflictions they ſerve to improve our graces, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>For they verily for a few dayes ehaſtened us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs,</hi> that is, <hi>that we might more and more be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheleſs, afterward it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the peaceable fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, unto them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Hence 'tis that the Saints glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. <hi>And not only ſo, but we glory in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations alſo, knowing that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, hope.</hi> Grace alwayes thrives moſt when Saints are
<pb facs="tcp:40722:20"/> under the Rod. When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are under the Rod, then their graces do not only bud, but bloſſome, and bring forth fruit as <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod did. The <note place="margin">Mum. 17. 8,</note> ſnuffing of the Candle, makes it burn the brighter. God beats and bruiſes his links, to make them burn the brighter; he bruiſes his ſpices, to make them ſend forth the greater Aromatical ſavour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> compares Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the <hi>Tezel,</hi> which though it be ſtarp and ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is to make the Cloath more pure and fine. The Jews were alwayes beſt, when they were in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Well-waters ariſing from deep ſprings, are hotter in the winter, than they are in the ſummer. Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights. Vines grow the better for
<pb facs="tcp:40722:20"/> bleeding; and Gold looks the brighter for ſcowring. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper ſmels ſweeteſt, when in the fire. <hi>Cammomile</hi> the more you tread it, the more you ſpread it. O Sirs, this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and a rare truth, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thought on, <hi>viz.</hi> that God will ſometimes more car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the growth and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace by a croſs, by an affliction, than by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>James</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>James</hi> 4. 8, 9. Afflictions ripen the Saints graces, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. Firſt or laſt God will make every Rod, yea, every twig in every Rod, to be an Ordinance to every afflicted Saint. By Afflictions God many times revives, quickens, and recovers, the decayed graces of his People. By Afflictions God many times enflames that love that is cold, and he ſtrengthens that
<pb facs="tcp:40722:21"/> faith that is failing, and he puts life into thoſe hopes that are languiſhing, and new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into thoſe joyes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that are withering and dying. Musk (ſay ſome) when it hath loſt its ſweetneſs, if it be put into the ſink amongſt filth, it recovers its ſweetn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> again: So doth ſmart afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons recover and revive our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed graces.</p>
            <p>I have read a ſtory of a Sexton, that went into the Church at night, to rob a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been buried the day before with a Gold ring upon her finger (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her deſire); now when he had opened the Grave and Coffin, and looſed the ſheet, he fell a rubbing and chafing her finger to get off the Gold Ring, and with rubbing and chafing of it, her ſpirits retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:40722:21"/> (ſhe having been but in a ſwoon before) and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and lived many years after. Smart Afflictions are but the rubbing and chafing of our graces. The ſmarting Rod abaſeth the lovelineſs of the world, that might entice us, it abates the Iuſtineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the fleſh within, that might incite us to vanity and folly, and it abets the ſpirit in his quarrel to the two former: All which tend much to the recovering and reviving of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed graces. But,</p>
            <p>The Sixth end to which the Rod ſerves, &amp; that is, to try the child, to make a diſcovery of the ſpirit of the child. Some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents never ſee ſo much of the badneſs of the ſpirits of their Children, as they do when they bring them under the Rod; and other Parents ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:40722:22"/> ſee ſo much of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſpirits of their Children, as they do when they chaſtiſe them with the Rod: 'Tis ſo here, when God afflicts ſome, O the pride, the ſtoutneſs, the croſneſs, the hardneſs, the peeviſhneſs and ſtubborneſs of ſpirit that they <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 2.

By ſmart Afflictions God tryes the graces of his People, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers what is in the ſpirits of his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 10, 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 6, 7. The fire tryes the Gold, as
<pb facs="tcp:40722:23"/> well as the Touch-ſtone. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes try the Art of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and Tempeſts try the skill of the Pilot. Every ſmarting Rod is a Touch-ſtone, both to try our graces, and to diſcover our ſpirits. Prudent Fathers will ſometimes croſs their Children, to try, to diſcover, the diſpoſitions of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 5,—21.</note> And ſo doth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits deal ſometimes with his Children.</p>
            <p>The manner of the <hi>Pſylli</hi> (which are a kind of People <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 28</note> of that temper and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no Venom will hurt them) is this, if they ſuſpect any Child to be none of their own, they ſet an Adder upon it to ſting it, and if it cry, and the fleſh ſwell, they caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as a ſpurious iſſue, but if it do not quatch nor cry, nor is never the worſe for it, then
<pb facs="tcp:40722:23"/> they account it for thei own, and make very much of it. The Application is eaſie. But,</p>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt end of the Rod, Is to prepare &amp; fit the <note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 10.</note> chaſtiſed for greater ſervices, favours and mercies. Many a Child, and many a ſervant had never been ſo fit for emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervices as they are, had they not been under a ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rod. 'Tis very uſual with God, to caſt men into very great Afflictions, and to lay them under grievous ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rods, that ſo he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and fit them for ſome high and eminent ſervices in this world. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had never been ſo fit to be Governour <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44.</note> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to preſerve the viſible Church of God alive in the World, if he had not been ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> if his feet
<pb facs="tcp:40722:24"/> had not been hurt in the <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 7, 8.</note> ſtocks, and if the Irons had not entred into his ſoul. Nor <hi>Moſes</hi> had never been ſo fit to be a Leader, and a Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as he was, if he had <note place="margin">Gen. 50. 20.</note> not been baniſhed Fourty Yeares in the Wilderneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nor <hi>Davids</hi> Crown had never ſat ſo well, nor ſo cloſe, nor ſo long on his head, as it did, had he not for ſome years before been hunted, as a Partridge in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nor the <hi>Three Children</hi> (or rather, the <hi>Three Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions)</hi> would never have been fit for ſo high a Rule, had <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 29, 30.</note> they not been firſt caſt into the fiery Furnace. Nor <hi>Daniel,</hi> for that exceeding high honour, and glory, and greatneſs, to which he was exalted, had he <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 25,<hi>—ult.</hi>
               </note> not been firſt caſt among the Lyons. And ſo had <hi>Eſther</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:24"/> never been a poor Captive-Maid, ſhe had never been a Queen, and ſo had never been inſtrumental in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God in her day. <hi>Heman</hi> was one of the beſt and wiſeſt men in <note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 31.</note> the World (in his day), and this God brought him to, by training of him up in the School of Affliction, as you may evidently, ſee in that 88. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> That of the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. deſerves to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in letters of gold, <hi>Who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> Mark that word, <hi>able.</hi> O 'tis one of the hardeſt and nobleſt works in all Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be able divinely to comfort others that are in
<pb facs="tcp:40722:25"/> troubles; and yet by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings God fits and prepares his People, for this noble and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> was of Opinion, that to comfort a diſtreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, was a greater work, than to raiſe the dead to life. And yet by inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings, God fits his People for this great work.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee, in what reſpects Afflictions are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Rod.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I am to do, is to ſhew you thoſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Leſſons, that you are to learn by the Rod, (or if you pleaſe,) by the raging <hi>Peſtilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they are theſe,</p>
            <p>The firſt Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> is to know, what the particular
<pb facs="tcp:40722:25"/> meſſage or errand is, which the Rod hath to deliver to you in the day of your diſtreſſe and trouble. Your firſt work is to do as <hi>David</hi> did, in that 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. He humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the Lord, to know the particular reaſon why he ſent a Famine amongſt them. You muſt do as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Shew me, O Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou contendeſt with me. Job</hi> would fain know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and him. One well obſerves on the Text, <hi>that Job was very deſtrous to know, whether God did afflict him for ſin, or for tryal, not to ſatisfie his curioſitie but, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Elihu's</hi> counſel to <hi>Job muſt here take place, Job</hi> 34. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:26"/> 
               <hi>any more. That which I ſee not teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. Job</hi> it ſeems was yet in the dark, as to the particular cauſe or reaſon, why the Lord had ſo grievouſly afflicted him; and therefore he is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with God, that he would graciouſly point out the ſin, for which he had ſo ſorely ſmitten him. Thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſeem to be very ſtrange and ſevere; I am more heavily afflicted than others, and yet I do not know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have ſinned more than others: Why I ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and caſt, without a Tryal, why thou art ſo hot againſt me, and why thou haſt multiplied ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of miſeries upon me, and why thou haſt ſo greatly
<pb facs="tcp:40722:26"/> ſubjected me to the ſaddeſt and ſoureſt cenſures of others, as if I were the worſt of ſinners, and the baſeſt of hypocrites, I know not: And therefore O Lord, I humbly deſire, that thou wouldeſt not deal with me according to thy abſolute Power, but let me know the true grounds and cauſes of all my heavy ſorrows and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And ſo he is at it again, in that <hi>Job</hi> 13. 23. <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins? make me to know my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and my ſin.</hi> My plagues, O Lord, are unparalel'd; if my ſins are ſuch let me know it, ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> My calamities tranſcend the calamities of all others; if my ſins do ſo, let them not be hid from mine eyes, O Lord. My load, O Lord is heavier than others; and therefore if my ſins are
<pb facs="tcp:40722:27"/> greater than others, let me ſee them, let me underſtand them: Infirmities and weakneſſes, I confeſſe, do hang upon me, they are inherent in me, and they do too often iſſue and flow from me; but as for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities or wickedneſſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my cenſorious Friends, nor yet my worſt enemies, no, nor yet my own Conſcience, will ever be able to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny juſt, or clear proof againſt me: O Lord, I have many ſpots upon me, but if there be any upon me that are not the ſpots of thy People, let me ſee them, let me know them, that I may abhor my ſelf, and juſtifie thee, and that I may ſay, my Friends are righteous in their cenſures, and I have done wickedly before the Lord. Sometimes Afflictions are ſent only for tryal and inſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:27"/> and not at all for ſin; this is evident in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> and in the caſe of the <hi>Blind man,</hi> whoſe afflictions, though they were very great and grievous, <note place="margin">John 3. 9.</note> yet were they not for ſin, but for tryal.</p>
            <p>Now though this be true, yet it muſt be granted, that <note place="margin">Mic. 1. 5,—10.</note> commonly ſin is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, the procuring cauſe of all Afflictions. Sin ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is the Original and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our troubles <note place="margin">Amos 2. 4, 5, 6.</note> and chaſtiſements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32. <hi>If his Children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgements; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandements: Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes. Jer.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back-ſlidings ſhall</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:28"/> 
               <hi>reprove thee: know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts. Amos</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth; therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what courſe muſt we take? what meanes muſt we uſe, to find out that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin, for which God corrects us, or, which hath brought the Rod upon us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Obſerve what that ſin is, that thy Conſcience doth moſt upbraid thee with, and check thee for. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Gods Preacher in the <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21. Chap. 50. 15, 16, 17.</note> boſome. Now obſerve what that particular ſin is, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth moſt ſmartly and roundly correct, and chaſtiſe
<pb facs="tcp:40722:28"/> thee for, for 'tis ten to one but that is the ſin, that hath brought the Rod upon thee. The voice of Conſcience, and the voice of the Rod, do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eccho one to another. 'Tis very rare to find a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the language of Conſcience, and the language of the Rod. Conſcience is Gods Deputy, Gods Spie, Gods Notary, Gods Viceroy; and therefore do not deſpiſe the voice of Conſcience, do not turn off Conſcience, as <hi>Felix</hi> turned off <hi>Paul.</hi> If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <note place="margin">Acts 24. 25</note> cry of Conſcience be, O this is for thy Pride, or this is for thy Paſſion, or this is for thy Self-love, or this is for thy earthlineſs, or this is for thy carnalneſs, or this is for thy hypocriſie, or this is for thy formality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will be thy wiſdome to ſubſcribe to
<pb facs="tcp:40722:29"/> the ſecret cry of Conſcience. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seriouſly obſerve what that ſin is, that thy ſoul would have ſpared above all, that thy ſoul is moſt unwilling to leave, and bid an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting farewel to. Obſerve what thy right hand ſin, thy <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 6, 7. Eſt. 5. 13.</note> boſome ſin, thy conſtitution ſin, thy complexion ſin is, for 'tis a hundred to one, but that God hath ſent the Rod; for the ſubduing of that very ſin. Commonly by the Rod God points at the mortifying of that particular ſin, to which the heart ſtands moſt ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve what that ſin is, that doth moſt maim and mar thy confidence and <note place="margin">1 John 3. 20, 21.</note> boldneſs, in all thy addreſſes and approaches to God; for doubtleſſe that is the ſin,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:29"/> that God would ſubdue and bring under by the Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve what the affliction, what the pain, what the diſeaſe, what the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is, that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for ſometimes a perſon may run and read his ſin in his very puniſhment, <hi>Judges</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my Table: as I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi> Now ſhall <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prince run and read his ſin in his puniſhment; and ſhall not a Chriſtian much more? ſhall not grace do as much as blind nature? Look as a man may ſometimes gueſs at the diſeaſe of the Patient, by the prudent obſerving of the Phyſitians Bill; ſo may he
<pb facs="tcp:40722:30"/> ſometimes gueſs at the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin that God would have deſtroyed, by the puniſhment that is inflicted. God uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt or laſt, meets with men, and payes them home in their own coyn: Is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhame? then the ſin was pride; is the Judgment want, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine? <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 8, 9.</note> then the ſin was abuſe of abundance; is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oppreſſion? then the ſin was unmercifulneſs; is the Judgment loſs of Children? then the ſin was inordinate love to them. <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were too indulgent to their Children; and therefore they were puniſhed in them and by them: Is the Judgment ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or want of health? then the ſin was, either the abuſe of health, or the non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of health: Is the Judgment a famine of the Word? then the
<pb facs="tcp:40722:30"/> ſin was, ſlighting and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word: Is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment War? then the ſin was abuſe of peace: Is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a blind, cold, carnal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, formal, drunken, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Clergy? then the ſin hath been ſlighting, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, undervaluing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing, an able, knowing, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſpiritual, and powerful miniſtry: Is the Judgment, a worſhipping of God in a lazy, dry, dull, dead, formal, cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary way, according to the inventions and traditions of the Elders? then the ſin hath been mens not worſhipping of <note place="margin">John 4. 23, 24.</note> God in ſpirit and in truth, and with that zeal, ſpirit, life, warmth, and fervency, as he requires: Is the Judgment, the breaking of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 11.</note> of Gods People, and ſcattering of them into holes
<pb facs="tcp:40722:31"/> and corners, as it was in <hi>Ahabs,</hi>

            <p>Fifthly, Obſerve whether you have not been very faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards others, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things you now ſuffer your ſelves.

<pb facs="tcp:40722:31"/> and if you muſt plead guilty, throw the firſt ſtone at your <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 1, 2.</note> ſelves, and ſay with <hi>Adonibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek, As I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi> Let every laſh of God upon you, put you in mind of your deportment towards others, when God hath given them Gall and Wormwood to drink. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Obſerve what that ſin is, that thou canſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 25, 30. Prov. 12. 1. Pro. 17. 10. Prov. 9. 8. Pro. 15. 12.</note> ſhould be touched, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, or ſpoken againſt. Ah how proud, how impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, how paſſionate, how mad are many, when you come to touch their right-eye-ſin. When you come to touch them in the tender part, O then they fume, and ſwell, and rage, and take on like men and women out of their wits, as you may ſee in the Scribes and Phariſees, who were ſo
<pb facs="tcp:40722:32"/> angry and mad with Chriſt, that they ſought his death; and all becauſe he was ſtill a pointing at the Toads in their boſomes, <hi>viz.</hi> pride, vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hypocriſie, and ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: O they could not endure that the ſharp Raſor of reproof ſhould come neer their ſoreſt part. Certainly that Chriſtian muſt be under a very high diſtemper, that cannot but ſmite a righteous man with reproach, for ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a reproof. Though gracious reproofs are choice Phyſick, yet few ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs can tell how to bear them. Moſt Chriſtians are for lenitives, few for are corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives. <hi>David</hi> was glad of a healing reproof; but there are <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 5.</note> but few <hi>Davids</hi> alive. Who is angry with the Phyſitian for preſcribing a bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb facs="tcp:40722:32"/> and yet, ah how angry are many Chriſtians, when they come to fall under holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, eſpecially if there be any of that ſharpneſs and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingneſs in them, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts to, in that <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. Now doubtleſs the voice of the Rod is this, Soul take heed of that ſin, that thou canſt not endure ſhould be touched Labour mightily with God to get that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin mortified, that thou canſt not endure ſhould be reproved. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Obſerve what ſin that is, that doth moſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 16, 17.</note> thee from cloſing with the precious promiſes, and from living upon precious promiſes, and from improving of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, and from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up of precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and from appropiating of
<pb facs="tcp:40722:33"/> precious promiſes to thine own ſoul; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that for the ſubduing of that ſin, the Lord hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited thee with his fatherly Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Obſerve what ſin that is, that did moſt ſting and terrefie thee in an evil day, as when thou haſt been <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21</note> under ſome loathſome diſeaſe, or tormenting pain, be it ſtone, gout, or burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or when thou haſt been in ſome eminent danger, or when thou haſt had a ſentence of death upon thee, and there hath been but a ſhort ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and eternity. Doubtleſs that ſin, which hath lain as a heavy load upon thy Conſcience in the dayes of thy former diſtreſſe, that is the ſin that God would have effectually conquered, and
<pb facs="tcp:40722:33"/> brought under by his preſent Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Obſerve what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin that is, that doth moſt hinder thee in holy duties and ſervices, and that doth moſt interrupt thee in thy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, enquire what particular ſin that is, that thy <note place="margin">Eze. 33. 31.</note> heart is moſt apt to run after, when thou art on the Mount of holy duties. Whileſt the Diſciples were healing diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and caſting Devils out of other mens bodies, the proud white Devil was ſtirring in their own ſouls, as is evident by that gentle rebuke that our Saviour gives them in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. <hi>In this rejoyce not, that the ſpirits are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; but rather rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your names are written in Heaven.</hi> There is no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that a Chriſtian performs,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:34"/> but one white Devil or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one luſt or another, will be ſtill dogging and following of him to that Duty. There is no publick Duty, there is no family duty, there is no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duty, that a Chriſtian performs, but either that white Divel, Pride, or that white Devil, Hypocriſie, or that white Divel, vain-glory, or elſe ſome one or another white Devil will follow the Soul, hard at heel to it. Now mark what that particular ſin is, that moſt haunts thy ſoul, when thou art in Religious duties and ſervices, and it may be that is the very ſin that God would have ſubdued by the Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Obſerve what ſin that is, that the reſt of your corruptions are moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, and that they moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:40722:34"/> upon: Mark what ſin that is, that all other ſins doe moſt bow the knee to: Mark that ſin that hath a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power over all other ſins, that ſaith to one, go, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; to another, come, and he cometh: Mark what ſin that is, that is ſtill uppermoſt, and that all other ſins do moſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to. You know when a man hath a great wound in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all the ill humours will run thither. Obſerve what ſin that is, that all the ill humours of the ſoul do moſt run after, for 'tis very likely that that is the very ſin that God would have brought under by the Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Obſerve what that ſin is, that your hearts are moſt apt to hide, and cloak, &amp; cover over with the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and fair pretences. <hi>Saul</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:35"/> had a covetous deſire, and he <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 20, 21.</note> covers it over with fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that the people would have it ſo, and that what was ſpared was for ſacrifice. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> favour was the great <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 24.</note> darling in <hi>Pilates</hi> eyes, but he covers all over with waſhing his hands. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were exceeding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, but their long prayers, <note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> as a cloak, muſt cover all. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> alſo was a man of the ſame mind and mettle with them, <hi>What need this wast, why was not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 8, 9. John 12. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>this oyntment ſold for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, &amp; given to the poor? This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor; but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> thinks) was pretty honeſt till he carried the bag; but no ſooner was he in office, but he puts Conſcience
<pb facs="tcp:40722:35"/> out of office, but all muſt be covered over with a cloake of charity. Obſerve what ſin that is, that you are moſt apt to caſt the Silk, or the Satin mantle over, and 'tis ten to one, but that is the ſin that God would have brought under by the Rod. But,</p>
            <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what that ſin is, that thou art moſt eaſily overcome by. <hi>Dalilah</hi> could eaſily overcome <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when all the world beſides could make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt upon him. The Apoſtle <note place="margin">Heb 12. 1.</note> bids us, <hi>lay aſide the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi> There are ſome ſins that find more eaſie approaches to us, and more eaſie acceptance with us, &amp; accordingly they do more eaſily captivate us. Obſerve what that ſin is, that you doe moſt readily and eaſily open
<pb facs="tcp:40722:36"/> the door to, and doubtleſſe that is the ſin that God would have mortified and ſubdued by the Rod.</p>
            <p>The Second Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by <note place="margin">Pray turn to theſe Scriptures 2 Chron. 28. 10. Jer. 8. 6. Ezek, 7. 15, 16.</note> the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judg your ſelves, and greatly to humble your ſouls, for that ſin or ſins that hath brought the Rod upon you, thus <hi>David</hi> did in that 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10, 17. When you have found out the <hi>Achan</hi> that hath brought the Rod upon you, ſtone him to death, and lye humble and low under the Rod, and then the Allmighty will be graciouſly pacified, and ſweetly reconciled unto you.</p>
            <p>The Third Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is to view the Rod on every ſide;
<pb facs="tcp:40722:36"/> if there be bryers on one ſide of the Rod, there is Roſemary on the other ſide of the Rod; if there be wormwood and gall at one end of the Rod, there is ſweet honey at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Rod, as there was at the top of <hi>Jonathan's</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 43.</note> Rod.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould come into a Painters or a Limners ſhop, and ſee a Picture half drawn, it might trouble us and ſtartle us, if it did not fright us and amaze us; but yet when the Picture is perfected, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and finiſhed, it may prove a very beauteous, lovely, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piece. The Application is eaſie. Look as every Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every Affliction, every Rod hath its black, dark ſide; ſo every Judgement, every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hath its bright ſide to. Mow 'tis the wiſdom of a
<pb facs="tcp:40722:37"/> Chriſtian to look on the bright ſide of the Rod, the Cloud; as well as 'tis his work, to look on the dark ſide of the Rod, the Cloud: When a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an looks upon the dark ſide of the Cloud, he ſhould be humbled and abaſed; but when he looks upon the bright ſide of the Cloud, he ſhould be comforted and cheered. He <note place="margin">James 5. 11.</note> that is ſtill a looking on the briery ſide of the Rod, will be very apt to fret and faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod; but he that looks on the Roſemary ſide of the Rod, as well as the briery ſide of the Rod, he will bear up pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, gallantly, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Rod. The voice of the Rod is Look on both ſides, Look on both ſides. But,</p>
            <p>The fourth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, (or by
<pb facs="tcp:40722:37"/> the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is to look on the Rod, not abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the hand that holds it; but conjunctively, with the hand that holds it, thus <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 16, 10, 18, 19. Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> did, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. Thus <hi>Eli</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 11,—19. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. Thus <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. Yea, and thus <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, <hi>John</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Shall I not drink the Cup that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me to drink.</hi> Though the Cup was a bitter Cup, a bloody Cup, yet ſeeing it was put into his hand by his Father, he drinks it off, with a <hi>Father I thank thee.</hi> The Rod in its ſelf ſounds nothing but ſmart and blood to the Child; but the Rod in the hand of a Father ſounds nothing but love, kindneſs, and ſweetneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Whom he loves he</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:38"/> 
               <hi>chaſtens.</hi> You ſhould never look upon the Rod, but as it is in the hand of your heavenly Father, and then you will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiſs it, than murmur un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. But,</p>
            <p>The Fifth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is to cleave and cling cloſe to God under the Rod. O how doth the Child cling and hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Father when he takes up the Rod; let ſuch a Child-like Spirit be found in you, when the Father of Spirits takes up up the Rod. When the Rod was upon <hi>Davids</hi> back, O how doth he cleave to God, even as the Wife cleaves to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for ſo much the Hebrew word <hi>Dabak</hi> in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 8. imports. So when <hi>Job</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod, O how doth he cling about God! <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 21.
<pb facs="tcp:40722:38"/> 
               <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him. Job</hi> will hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a killing God. So the Church in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 15, 16, 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So thoſe hundred fourty and four thouſand that had their Fathers names written in their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1,—6. O Friends, you never ſhew ſo much Child-like love, nor ſo much Child-like ingenuity, nor ſo much Child-like inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as you do ſhew when under the ſmarting Rod, you are found clinging about the Lord, and hanging upon the Lord by an exerciſe of grace. When <hi>Antiſtenes</hi> held up his Staffe, as if he intended to beat on of his Scholers out of his School, the Scholar told him, <hi>that he might ſtrike him if he pleaſed, but he ſhould never find a ſtaffe of ſo hard wood, as ſhould ever be able to beat him</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:39"/> 
               <hi>him from him.</hi> When no Staff, no Rod, no Affliction, can drive us from Chriſt, it is a ſure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that we have profited much in the School of Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p>The Sixth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is to prepare to meet the Lord whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Rod is in his hand, <hi>Am.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Now there is a two-fold preparation.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is a Negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and this lyes in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heed of ſinning againſt Light and Conſcience; for thoſe ſins that are againſt a clear Light, and an awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are moſt wounding, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, terrifying, and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40722:39"/>
            <p> Secondly, There is a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive preparation, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in repentance &amp; returning to the Lord, and in abaſing and humbling your ſelves before <note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 14.</note> the Allmighty. As there is no running from God, ſo there is no contending with God; for what is the chaff to the Whirlwind, or the ſtubble to a conſuming fire? And therefore the voyce of the Rod is, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet the Lord in a way of faith, and repentance; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet the Lord in an exerciſe of grace; prepare to meet the Lord with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tears, and ſtrong cryes. But,</p>
            <p>The Seventh Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is to acknowledge Gods ſoveraign power and authority over the Rod, to bow it, or break it, or
<pb facs="tcp:40722:40"/> burn it, or take it off, or lay it more or leſs on, as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 13. Deut. 28. 58, 59, 60, 61.</note> All diſeaſes and ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are under the command of God, they are all his Sergeants, his ſervants, to execute his pleaſure: That <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 5. is an obſervable Text; Chriſt tells the Centurion, that he would come and heal his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; the Centurion tells him, that he was not worthy that he ſhould come under his roof, only if he would but ſpeak the word, his ſervant ſhould be healed; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>I am a man under Authority, having Souldiers under me: &amp; I ſay to this man go, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and to another come, and he cometh; and to my ſervant do this and he doth it. Now when Jeſus heard this, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and ſaid to them that followed, Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:40"/> 
               <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 10. But wherein did the greatneſs of the Centurions faith appear? why, in this very acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all diſeaſes were to Chriſt as ſervants, and that they were as much under the command of Jeſus Chriſt, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſervant under heaven is under the command of his Maſter: When Chriſt bids them go and afflict ſuch a man, they go; and torment ſuch a man, they go; and kill ſuch a man, they go; and ſo when he calls them off, they come off at his call. Dear Friends, it is a very great point of faith to believe theſe five things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God is the author of all the diſeaſes, malladies, and ſickneſſes, that be in the World, and that he ſets them on and call them off at his own
<pb facs="tcp:40722:41"/> good will and pleaſure, <hi>Amos</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lev. 26. Deut. 28.</note> 3. 6. <hi>Is there any evil in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hath not the Lord done it?</hi> He ſpeaks of the evil of puniſhment, and not of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſin. It was a mad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who refer'd all calamities to the Devil for their author, as if there could be evil in the City, and the Lord have no hand in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a great point of Faith to believe, that all diſeaſes and ſickneſſes are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by God, in reſpect of places. God ſent diſeaſes of all ſorts into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he forbad them <hi>Goſhen, Exod.</hi> 8. 20, 21, 22, 23. Chap. 9, 23, 24, 25, 26. Ponder ſeriouſly upon theſe Scriptures. Gods ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arrows into one Town, and not into another, into one City, and not into another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:40722:41"/> one Kingdome, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, into one family, &amp; not into another, doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evidence, that all diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſickneſſes, are limited by the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in reſpect of places.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a very great point of Faith, to believe that all ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes, are limited by God in reſpect of perſons; that they are ſo, is evident in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 3,—8. <hi>Iſa</hi> 65. 12. But who lives in the faith of this truth? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the ſame houſe one is infected, and the other is not; ſometimes in the ſame bed, the one is ſmitten, and the other is not; ſometimes at the ſame table, the one is taken away, and the other is left, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this doth roundly evidence and witneſs, that all ſickneſſes and diſeaſes are limited by
<pb facs="tcp:40722:42"/> God in reſpect of perſons, as well as in reſpect of places. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is a great point of Faith, to believe that all diſeaſes and ſickneſſes are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by God in reſpect of the degrees to which they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. That God that ſets bounds to the raging Sea, and that ſaith unto it, <hi>Thus far ſhalt thou go, and no further;</hi> that God ſets bounds to all raging diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, and ſaith unto them, thus far you ſhall go, and no further: He ſets bounds to the Feaver; he ſaith to it, go and ſcorch and burn up ſuch a body ſo much, and no more; and to the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, go and drown ſuch a body ſo much, and no more; and to the raging <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> go and weaken ſuch a body ſo much, and no more; and to the
<pb facs="tcp:40722:42"/> Stone, go and torment ſuch a body ſo much, and no more. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is a very great point of Faith, to believe that all diſeaſes and ſickneſſes are limited by God, as to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: God ſaith to one diſeaſe, go hang upon ſuch a man, ſo many years; to another, go hang up ſuch a man but a few years; and to another, go hang upon ſuch a man but a year; and to another, go hang upon ſuch a man but a few months; and to another, go hang upon ſuch a man but a few weeks; and to another, go hang upon ſuch a man but a few dayes; and to another, go hang upon ſuch a man but a few hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it cometh to paſs. But,</p>
            <p>The eighth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod, (or
<pb facs="tcp:40722:43"/> by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24. 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. Eccl. 1. 2. Prov. 23. 5.

A man never comes to experience ſo much of the emptineſs, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, the uſeleſneſs, the vanity, the mutability, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, the inſufficiency, and the uncertainty of all worldly comforts, and enjoyments, as when he comes to fall under the Rod. The conſtant cry of the Rod is, Be dead to the profits, pleaſures, honours, and applauſes of the world, be dead to relations, be dead to friends, be dead to every thing below a living Jeſus. But,</p>
            <p>The ninth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to get aſſurance of greater, and better things, than any this
<pb facs="tcp:40722:43"/> world doth afford. That ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 33, 34.</note> is as true, as it is old, <hi>viz. That the aſſurance of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, is the life of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life:</hi> But having ſpoke ſo much of this particular in my Treatiſe on <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> which is now in your hands, I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf with this hint at preſent. But,</p>
            <p>The tenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is, not to deſpiſe the Rod, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>My Son, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord.</hi> The Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Firſt, That it is an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be deſpiſed: 'Tis a <note place="margin">Am. 3. 6.

            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is a holy hand, it is a juſt and righteous hand, it is a faithful hand of God; and therefore do not deſpiſe it, <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 17, 18, 19. Lev. 26. 25. Jer 14. 12, 13, 14. 15. 16</note>

            <p>The Eleventh Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence,)</hi> is, not to be diſcouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod, <hi>Heb.</hi>

               <hi>faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> Firſt, It is a Rod in a fathers hand; and therefore do not faint under it. Secondly, God will do much good by the Rod; and therefore do not faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod. Thirdly, You could not have been without the Rod; and therefore do not faint under the Rod.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Rod that is now upon, is not according to the greatneſs of Gods anger, nor according to to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power, nor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrictneſs of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb facs="tcp:40722:45"/> nor according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of your ſins, nor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the malitious deſires of Satan, nor according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, plots, and contrivances, of wicked and unreaſonable men, nor according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs of your fears, for you have feared worſe things than you feel, nor according to that Rod that hath been upon the Primitive Saints, nor accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Rod, that many thouſands of the precious ſons and daughters of <hi>Zion</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in other parts of the world, and therefore do not faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod, do not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged under the Rod.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, by fainting under the Rod, you will gratifie Satan, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach religion, render your ſelves unſerviceable, and make work for future Repentance; and therefore do not faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod. But,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40722:46"/>
            <p> The Twelfth Leſſon that you <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 25, 26. Lev. 26. 40, 41, 42. Mic. 7. 9. Lam. 3. 30. Luke 21. 10.</note> are to learn under the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, humbly to kiſs the Rod, and patiently &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to lye under the Rod, till the Lord ſhall either give you a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or a glorious deliverance from it. What is the Rod, and what is the raging <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> to the horrors of Conſcience, to the flames of hell, or to an everlaſting ſeparation from the preſence of the Lord, and <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that hath deſerved a hanging, if he eſcape with a whipping, hath no cauſe to murmur or complain; and we that have deſerved a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, have little cauſe to murmur or complain of a whipping, yea, though it ſhould be with a <hi>Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial-Rod.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>The thirteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, highly, fully, freely, and ſignally to juſtifie the Lord, and to think well of the
<pb facs="tcp:40722:46"/> Lord, &amp; to ſpeak well of the Lord, under the Rod; to that purpoſe conſult theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 75, 137. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 33. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 4, 15, 18. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 12. 14. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Pſal</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 2. But,</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, perſonal refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. When the Rod ſmarts, &amp; the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> rageth, God expects that every man ſhould ſmite upon his thigh, and turn from the evil of his doings, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>If I ſhut up heaven, that there be no rain, or if I command the locuſts to devour the Land, or if I ſend Peſtilence among my people: If my people which are called by my name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, &amp; ſeek my face, &amp; turn from their wicked wayes; then will I hear from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; will forgive their ſin, &amp; will heal their Land;</hi> that is, <hi>I will remove the judgments that are upon the Land, &amp; I will confer upon my reforming people all thoſe favours &amp; bleſſings that they ſtand</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:47"/> 
               <hi>in need of.</hi> Conſult theſe Scriptures, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10. 14, 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 8, 9. And chap. 29. 8, 10, 15, 16. But,</p>
            <p>The Fifteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to make God your habitation, your ſhelter, your refuge. Ponder ſeriouſly upon theſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 2, 9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. 1. They dwell moſt ſafely, moſt ſecurely, moſt nobly, who dwell in God, who live under the ſhadow of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and who every day lodge their ſouls in the boſome of eternal loves. But,</p>
            <p>The Sixteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to ſet up God as the great object of your fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 119, 120. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 13, 14. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. When the Judgments of God are either threatned or executed, feared or felt, it highly concerns us to lift up God, as the main object of our fear; we ſhould fear the hand that layes on the Rod, more than <note place="margin">Job 13. 11. Jer. 36. 24.</note> the Rod it ſelf. When God takes up
<pb facs="tcp:40722:47"/> the Rod, when he draws his ſword, and when he ſhoots his <hi>Peſtilential</hi> arrows amongſt us, O how highly doth it concern us to fear before him with a child-like fear, with a reverential fear, with a fear that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the heart againſt ſin, and with a fear that fits the Soul for duty, &amp; that draws, yea drives the ſoul to duty. But,</p>
            <p>The ſeventeenth leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to expect Gods ſingular preſence with you, and his admirable protection over you. Conſult theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 39, 40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 20, 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4, 6.

He is before them, &amp; behind them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 12. &amp; chap. 58. 8. He is on the right hand of his people, and he is on the left hand of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 118. 15, 16 <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 22, 29.

But,</p>
            <p>The eighteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is to live every day in a freſh, choice, &amp; frequent excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace. Conſult theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 39. 17, 18. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 1, 2. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Ninteenth Leſſon that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging <hi>Peſtilence)</hi> is, to quicken up your hearts to ſeek the Lord by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wayes &amp; means, <hi>viz.</hi> by faſting &amp; prayer. Conſult theſe
<pb facs="tcp:40722:48"/> Scriptures, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 46,<hi>—ult. Pſal.</hi> 106. 23, 29, 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13. <hi>Jon.</hi> 3. 5,<hi>—ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 21,<hi>—ult. Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 15. 16, 17. But,</p>
            <p>The Twentieth, and ſo the laſt Leſſon, that you are to learn by the Rod (or by the raging peſtilence) is, <hi>To prepare for death, it is to be in actual readineſs to dye.</hi> Ah Friends, every ach, every pain, every diſeaſe, is one of deaths warning pieces. There is not a head-ach, not a tooth-ach, not a gripe, not a grief, not a fall, not a wrench, not a plague-ſore; but is a divine warning to man, to prepare to die. <hi>'Tis a ſoleemn work to die, and therefore we had need prepare to die. 'Tis a work that is to be done but once; and therefore we had need prepare to do that work well, that is to be done but once.</hi> In this world, we hear often, &amp; pray often, &amp; read often, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate often, &amp; eat often, &amp; drink of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">Job 14. 14. Heb. 9. 27.</note> and that which is worſt, we ſin often; <hi>but we muſt die but once. Death will try all our graces, &amp; all our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, &amp; all our evidences, &amp; all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:49"/>

               </note> 
               <hi>enjoyments; and therefore we had need to prepare to die.</hi> Though there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain than death, yet there is nothing more uncertain than, 1. The time when we ſhall die. 2. The place where we ſhall die. And 3. The manner how we ſhall die; as whether we ſhall die a ſudden death, or a lingring death, or a violent death; or whether we ſhall fall by the ſword abroad, or by famine or peſtilence at home, or whether we ſhall fall by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or that; and therefore we had need be alwayes in an actual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to die. <hi>No man ſhall die the ſooner, but much the eaſier, and the better, for preparing to die: And therefore let us alwayes have our loins girt, and our lamps burning.</hi> As death leaves us ſo Judgment will find us; and there fore we have very great cauſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our intereſt in Chriſt, a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature, and a pardon in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; that ſo we might have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to die. <hi>Except, we prepare to die, all other preparations will</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40722:49"/> 
               <hi>do us no good.</hi> In a word, <hi>Death is a change, a great change, 'tis the the laſt change till the reſurrection, 'tis laſting, yea, an everlaſting change; for it puts a man into an eternall condition of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery; 'tis an univerſal change, all perſons muſt paſs under this flaming Sword.</hi> That Statute Law, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> will <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 18.</note> ſooner or later take hold on all mortals; and therefore it highly concerns us to prepare for death.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn you theſe Leſſons that you are to learn by the Rod. The Lord grant that your ſouls may fall under thoſe freſh, thoſe choice, thoſe full, and thoſe conſtant influences and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his holy Spirit, as may enable you to take out thoſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leſſons that I have laid open before you.

            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe <hi>Cloſet-prayer</hi> is a moſt ſovereign Remedy, a moſt precious Antidote of Gods own preſcribing againſt the <hi>Plague</hi> that now rageth in the midſt of us, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 37, 38, 39, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Becauſe every man is that really, which he is ſecretly. Never tell me, how handſomly, how neatly, how bravely, this or that man acts his part before others; but tell me (if thou canſt) how he acts his part before God in his Cloſet: for the man is that certainly, that he is ſecretly. There are many that ſweat upon the ſtage, that are key-cold in their Cloſets.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40722:51"/>
            <p> Seventhly, Though many worthies have done worthily upon all other parts of prayer, yet there are none either of a former or later date, that have fallen under my eye, that have written any <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on this <hi>Subject.</hi> I have not a little wondred that ſo many eminent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould paſs over this great and princely duty of <hi>Cloſet-prayer,</hi> either with a few brief touches, or elſe in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ſilence. If ſeveral Bodies of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> are conſulted, you will find that all they ſay clearly and diſtinctly as to <hi>Cloſet-prayer,</hi> may be brought into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow compaſs, if not into a nut-ſhell. I have alſo enquired of ſeveral old <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> whether among all the thouſand Sermons that they have heard in their dayes, that ever they have heard one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on <hi>Cloſet-prayer?</hi> and they have anſwered <hi>No.</hi> I have alſo enquired of them, whether ever they had read any <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on that <hi>Subject?</hi> and they have anſwered <hi>No.</hi> And truly this hath been no ſmall encouragement to me, to make an offer of my <hi>mite,</hi> and if this ſmall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of mine ſhall be ſo bleſt, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others that have better heads, and
<pb facs="tcp:40722:52"/> hearts, and hands, than any I have, to do Chriſt and his people more ſervice, in the handling of this choice point in a more copious way than what I have been able to reach unto: I ſhall therein rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, That favour, that good acceptance, and fair quarter, that my other poor labours have found, not onely in this Nation, but in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes alſo, hath put me upon putting pen to paper once more: and I hope that the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh, will reſt upon this, as it hath (to the glory of free grace) reſted upon my former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavers. I could add other reaſons, but let theſe ſuffice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Reader,</hi> when thou art in thy Cloſet, pray hard for a poor weak, worthleſs worm, that I may be found faithful and fruitful to the death, that ſo at laſt I may receive a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> So wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee all happineſs both in this lower and in that upper World; I reſt</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Matth. 6. 6.</bibl>
               <q>But thou when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet; and when thou haſt ſhut thy Door, Pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are plain, and to be taken litterally, and not Allegorically, for he ſpeaketh of ſhutting the Door of the Chamber. In this chapter there is a manifeſt oppoſition between
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40722:57"/> the Phariſees praying in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and corners of the ſtreets, and others praying in ſecret.</p>
            <p>In the Text you have a poſitive Precept for every Chriſtian to pray alone; <hi>But thou, when thou prayeſt:</hi> he ſaith not, when <hi>(you)</hi> pray, but <hi>(thou) when (thou) prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet,</hi> &amp;c. as ſpeaking not ſo much of a joynt duty of many praying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as of a duty which each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to do alone. The command in the Text ſends us as well to the Cloſet as to the Church; and he is a hypocrite in grain that chooſes the one and neglects the other; for thereby he tells the world he cares for neither, he makes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of neither. He that puts on a religious habit abroad, to gain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great Name among men, and at the ſame time lives like an Atheiſt at home, ſhall at the laſt be uncas't by God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before all the world for a <note place="margin">

               </note> moſt egredious hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and ſome others, turn the Text into an Allegory; they ſay
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40722:57"/> that in theſe words there are two Allegories. Firſt, the Chamber Door is the Senſe: <hi>Shut the Door,</hi> that is (ſay they) thy Senſe, leſt vain imaginations, and worldly thoughts diſtract thy mind in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, The Door, ſay they, is our Mouth. <hi>Shut thy Door,</hi> that is, thy Lips (ſay they) and let thy Prayer be like the Prayer of <hi>Hannah,</hi> conceived in thy mind, but not uttered with thy mouth. 'Tis uſual with Papiſts, and other monkiſh men, that lye in wait to deceive, to turn the bleſſed Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures into a Noſe of Wax, under pretence of Allegories and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>Origen</hi> was a great admirer <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.</note> of Allegories; by the ſtrength of his parts and wanton wit, he turn'd moſt of the Scriptures into Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories; and by the juſt Judgement of God upon him, he fooliſhly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and abſurdly applied that <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 12. litterally <hi>(Some have made themſelves chaſte for the Kingdom of Heaven)</hi> and ſo gelded himſelf. And indeed he might as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40722:58"/> well have pluck't out one of his eyes upon the ſame account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is better to go to Heaven with one eye, than having two eyes to be caſt into Hell fire</hi> Matth. 18. 9. In all Ages Hereticks have commonly defended their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by tranſlating of Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Allegories. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch, as, denying the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, turn all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Reſurrection into an Allegory; meaning thereby only the ſpiritual Reſurrection of the ſoul from ſin; of which ſort was <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who deſtroyed the faith of ſome, ſaying <hi>the Reſurrection was paſt already,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18. And are there not many among us that turn the whole Hiſtory of the Bible into an Allegory; and that turn Chriſt, and Sin, and Death, and the Soul, and Hell, and Heaven, and all into an Allegory? Many have and many do miſerably pervert the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by turning them into vain and groundleſs Allegories. Some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40722:58"/> wanton wits have expounded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe <note place="margin">Philo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus, and others of a later date.</note> to be the Soul, Man to be the Mind, the Woman to be the Senſe, the Serpent to be Delight, the Tree of knowledge of good and evil to be Wiſdome, and the reſt of the Trees to be the Vertues and Endowments of the Mind. O friends it is dangerous to bring in Allegories, where the Scripture doth not clearly and plainly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them; and to take thoſe words Figuratively, which ſhould be taken properly.</p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is in the Text rendred Cloſet, hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three moſt uſual ſignifications amongſt Greek Authors.

Thirdly, for a locked Cheſt or Cupbord, wherein Treaſure uſually is reſerved.</p>
            <p>The beſt and moſt judicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters that I have caſt mine eye upon, both of a former and later date, do all expound my Text of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40722:59"/> Private Prayer in retired places, and with them I cloſe: And ſo the main Doctrine that I ſhall gather from the words is this:</p>
            <q>That Cloſet-Prayer (or Private-Prayer) is an indiſpenſible duty, that <note place="margin">Doct.</note> Chriſt himſelf hath laid upon all that are not willing to lye under the woful brand of being Hypocrites.</q>
            <p>I beſeech you ſeriouſly to lay to heart theſe five things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If any Prayer be a duty, then ſecret Prayer muſt needs be a duty; for ſecret Prayer is as much Prayer as any other Prayer is Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and ſecret Prayer prepares and fits the ſoul for Family-Prayer, and for Publick-Prayer. Secret-Prayer ſweetly enclines, &amp; ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſes a Chriſtian to all other religious duties and ſervices. <hi>Ergo.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Secret Prayer be not an indiſpenſible duty that lyes upon thee, by what authority doth Conſcience ſo upbraid thee, and ſo accuſe thee, and ſo condemn thee, and ſo terrifie thee, as it often doth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40722:59"/> for the neglect of this duty? But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Was it ever the way or method of God to promiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again a reward, an open reward for that work or ſervice which himſelf never commanded? Surely No. Now to this duty of Secret Prayer, the Lord hath again and again promiſed an open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. 18. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without all peradventure this is a duty incumbent upon all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Saviour in the Text takes it for granted, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child of God, will be frequent in praying to his heavenly Father, and therefore he encourages them ſo much the more in the work of Secret Prayer. <hi>When you Pray;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know you can as well hear without eares, and live without food, and fight without hands, and walk without feet, as you are able to live without Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And therefore when you go to wait on God, or to give your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father a viſit, <hi>Enter into your</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40722:60"/> 
               <hi>Cloſet, and ſhut your doors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If Cloſet Prayer be not an indiſpenſible duty that Chriſt hath laid upon all his people, why doth Satan ſo much oppoſe it, why doth he ſo induſtriouſly and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly labour to diſcourage Chriſtians in it, &amp; to take off Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from it? Certainly, Satan would never make ſuch a fierce &amp; conſtant war, as he doth upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayer; were it not a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty, a reall duty, and a ſoul-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching duty. But more of this you will find in the following diſcourſe; and therefore let this touch ſuffice for the preſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe five things do very clearly and evidently demonſtrate that ſecretly and ſolitarily to hold entercourſe with God is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted duty of every Chriſtian. But for a more full opening and confirmation of this great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Point, I ſhall lay down theſe Twenty Arguments or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <p>Firſt, The moſt eminent Saints,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40722:60"/> both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have applied themſelves to Private-Prayer. <hi>Moſes</hi> was alone in the Mount with God forty dayes and fourty nights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28. So <hi>Abraham</hi> fills his mouth with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and reaſons the caſe out alone with God in Prayer, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Sodoms</hi> deſolation and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and never leaves off pleading and praying till he had brought God down from fifty to ten, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 22-32. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 33. you have <hi>Abraham</hi> again at his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers, <hi>And Abraham planted a Grove in Beer-ſheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlaſting God.</hi> Why did <hi>Abraham</hi> plant a Grove, but that he might have a moſt private place to pray and poure out his ſoul before the Lord in? So <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24. 63. <hi>And Iſaac went out to meditate in the field at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Laſuach,</hi> that is here rendred Meditate, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to pray as well as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and ſo it is often uſed. 'Tis a comprehenſive word, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40722:61"/> takes in both Prayer and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So you ſhall find <hi>Jacob</hi> at his private-prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>And Jacob was left alone: and there wreſtled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</hi> When <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was all alone, and in a dark night, and when his joynts were out of joynt, he ſo wreſtles and weeps, and weeps and wreſtles in private Prayer, that as a Prince at laſt he prevailes with God. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3, 4. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 55. 16, 17. <hi>As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord ſhall ſave me. Evening, and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my voyce.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> was three times a day in private prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Now when Daniel knew that the Writing was ſign'd, he went into his houſe; and his Windows being open in his Chamber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jeruſalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Daniel</hi> had accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to private prayer; he went to his cloſet, before he went to his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40722:61"/> employment and State affairs: and at his return to dinner, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt into his Chamber to ſerve his God, and refreſh his ſoul, before he ſet down to feaſt his body: and at the end of the day, when he had diſpatcht his buſineſs with men, he made it his buſineſs to wait upon God in his Chamber. So <hi>Jonah</hi> keeps up private prayer, when he was in the Fiſhes belly, yea, when he was in the belly of Hell, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So we have <hi>Elias</hi> at prayer under the Juniper Tree, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. So <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. Now <hi>Hannah</hi> ſhe ſpeaks in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. The very ſoul of prayer lyes in the pouring out of the ſoul before God, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. Neither was <hi>Rebecah</hi> a ſtranger to this duty, who upon the Babes ſtrugling in her womb, went to enquire of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22. that is, ſhe went to ſome ſecret place to pray, ſaith <hi>Calvin, Muſculus, Mercer,</hi> and others. So <hi>Saul</hi> is no ſooner converted, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40722:62"/> he falls upon private prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, ariſe, and go into the ſtreet which is called</hi> Strait, <hi>and enquire in the houſe of Judas for one called Saul of Tarſus: for behold he prayeth.</hi> Though he was a ſtrict <hi>Phariſee,</hi> yet he never prayed to purpoſe before, nor never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in private before. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed to pray in the corners of the Streets, and not in the corners of their houſes. And after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he was frequently in private prayer, as you may ſee by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 15, 16. 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. So <hi>Epaphras</hi> was a warm man in cloſet prayer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12, 13. So <hi>Cornelius</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted himſelf to private prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 2, 4. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> gets up to the houſe top to pray, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>On the morrow as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the City, Peter went up upon the houſe-top to pray, about the ſixth hour. Peter</hi> got up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Leads, not only to avoid deſtraction, but that he might be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40722:62"/> the more ſecret in his private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us of <hi>James</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Juſtus,</hi> that his knees were grown hard and brawny with kneeling ſo much in private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And <hi>Nazianzen</hi> reports of his Siſter <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> that her knees ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cleave to the earth, by her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten praying in private. And <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſaith of his Aunt <hi>Trucilla,</hi> that her Elbows was as hard as horn by often leaning upon her Desk at private prayer. I have read of a devout perſon, who when the ſet time for his private devotion was come, whatever company he was in, he would break from them with this neat and handſome come off, <hi>I have a friend that ſtayes for me: Farewel.</hi> And there was once a great Lady of this Land, who would frequently withdraw from the company of Lords and Ladies of great quality (who came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her) rather than ſhe would loſe her ſet times of waiting upon God in her Cloſet; ſhe would, as they call'd it, rudely take her leave of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40722:63"/> them, that ſo ſhe might in private attend the Lord of Lords. She would ſpare what time ſhe could, to expreſs her favours, civilities, and courteſies, among her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Friends; but ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer them to rob God of his time, nor her ſoul of that comfort and communion which ſhe uſed to enjoy, when ſhe was with God in her Cloſet. And indeed one hours communion with God in ones clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, is to be preferr'd before the greateſt and beſt company in the World. And there was a child of a Chriſtian Gentle-woman, that was ſo given to prayer from its infancy, that before it could well ſpeak, it would uſe to get alone and go to prayer; and as it grew, it was more frequent in prayer, and retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf from company; and he would ask his Mother very ſtrange queſtions, far above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of one of his years: but at laſt, when this child was but five years old, and whipping of his top, on a ſudden he flung away his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40722:63"/> Scourge-ſtick and Top, and ran to his Mother, and with great joy ſaid unto her, <hi>Mother, I muſt go to God; will you go with me?</hi> She anſwered, My dear Child, how doſt thou know thou ſhalt go to God? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>God hath told me ſo, for I love God and God loves me.</hi> She anſwered, Dear Child, I muſt go when God pleaſeth. But why wilt thou not ſtay with me? The Child anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I will not ſtay, I muſt go to God.</hi> And the Child did not live above a moneth after, but never cared for play more; but falling ſick he would alwayes be ſaying, that he muſt go to God, he muſt go to God. And thus ſometimes, out of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 16.</note> mouthes of Babes and Sucklings God hath perfected praiſe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch perſons will be ripe for Heaven betimes, who begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſeek God in a Cloſet, in a Corner. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day he uſed to ſhut up himſelf in ſome ſecret place in his Palace, and there on bended knees, did
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40722:64"/> make his devout Prayers and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquies to God. My God and I are good company, ſaid famous Dr. <hi>Sibbs.</hi> A man whoſe ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with God in a Cloſer, in a Hole, behind the Door, or in a Deſart, a Den, a Dungeon, ſhall find more real pleaſure, more choice delight, and more full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than in the Pallace of a Prince. By all theſe famous Inſtances you ſee that the People of God in all Ages have addicted themſelves to private prayer. O friends, theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examples ſhould be very awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very convincing, and very encouraging to you. Certainly 'tis as much your duty as 'tis your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to follow theſe pious patterns that are now ſet before you: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>That thou mayeſt walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 3. 17. <hi>Brethren, be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40722:64"/> 
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Thoſe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. 6. <hi>And ye became fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of us, and of the Lord, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word in much affliction.</hi> Heb. 6. 12. <hi>That ye be not ſloathful, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, who through faith and patience inher it the Promiſes.</hi> So, 2 Tim. 3. 10, 11, 12, 14. Titus 2. 7. 'Twas an excellent Law that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> made, <hi>viz.</hi> That men ſhould propound to themſelves the beſt patterns, and ever bear in mind ſome eminent man. Bad men are wonderful in love with bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16, 17. The <hi>Indian</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Praecepto docent, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</note> that his Anceſtors were gone to Hell, ſaid, That then he would go thither too. Some men have a mind to go to hell for company-ſake. Oh that we were as much in love with the Examples of good men, as others are in love with the examples of bad men; and then we ſhould be oftner in our cloſets than now we are. Oh that our eyes were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40722:65"/> more fixed on the pious examples of all that have in them <hi>(aliquid Chriſti)</hi> any thing of Chriſt, as <hi>Bucer</hi> ſpake. Shall we love to look upon the Pictures of our Friends? and ſhall we not love to look upon the pious examples of thoſe that are the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lovely Picture of Chriſt? The pious examples of others ſhould be the looking-glaſſes by which we ſhould dreſs our ſelves. He is the beſt and wiſeſt Chriſtian, that writes after the faireſt Scripture Copy, that imitates thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that are moſt eminent in grace, and that have been moſt exerciſed in Cloſet-prayer, and in the moſt ſecret duties of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> having read the Life and Death of <hi>Hilarion</hi> (one that lived moſt Chriſtianly, and died moſt comfortably) folded up the Book ſaying, Well, <hi>Hilarion</hi> ſhall be the Champion that I will follow, his good life ſhall be my example, and his godly death my preſident. 'Tis brave to live and die by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the moſt eminent Saints. But,</p>

            <div n="2" type="argument">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40722:65"/>
               <p> Secondly, conſider, when Chriſt was on earth, he did much exerciſe himſelf in ſecret prayer, he was often with God alone, as you may ſee in theſe famous Scriptures. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when he had ſent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray; and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</hi> Chriſts chooſing ſolitudes for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer doth not only hint to us the danger of diſtraction and deviation of thoughts in prayer, but how neceſſary it is for us to chooſe the moſt convenient places we can for private prayers. Our own fickleneſs and Satans reſtleſneſs, calls upon us to get into ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, where we may moſt freely pour out our ſouls into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of God. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. <hi>And in the morning riſing up a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, he went out and departed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſolitary place, and there prayed.</hi> As the morning time is the fitteſt time for prayer, ſo ſolitary places are the fitteſt places for prayer. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 46. <hi>And when he had ſent them away,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40722:66"/> 
                  <hi>he departed into a mountain to pray.</hi> He that would pray to purpoſe had need be quiet when he is alone. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 16. <hi>And he withdrew himſelf into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and prayed. (Gr.</hi> He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting and praying; to give us to underſtand that he did thus often) When Chriſt was neither exerciſed in teaching nor in working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, he was then very intent on private prayer. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe dayes, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued all night in prayer to God.</hi> Did Chriſt ſpend whole nights in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer to ſave our ſouls; and ſhall we think it much to ſpend an hour or two in the day for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the internal and eternal welfare of our ſouls? <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 37. <hi>And in the day time he was teaching in the Temple, and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives.</hi> Chriſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joynes praying and preaching together; and thoſe whom Chriſt hath joyn'd together, let no man preſume to put aſunder. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40722:66"/> 39, 41, 44, 45. <hi>And he came out, and went as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives, and his Diſciples alſo followed him. And he was with-drawn from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneeled down and prayed. And being in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood</hi> (clotted or congealed blood) <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground</hi> (never was Garden watred before or ſince with blood as this was) <hi>And when he roſe up from prayer, and was come to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he found them ſleeping for ſorrow.</hi> Ah what ſad pieces of vanity are the beſt of men in an hour of trial and temptation. Theſe very men that a little before did ſtoutly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and promiſe, that they would never leave him nor forſake him, and that they would to priſon for Chriſt, and die for Chriſt, yet when the day of trial came, they could nor ſo much as watch with him one hour; they had neither eyes to ſee, nor hands to wipe off Chriſts bloody ſweat. So <hi>John</hi> 6. 15, 16, 17. Thus you ſee by all theſe famous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40722:67"/> Inſtances that Chriſt was frequent in private prayer. Oh that we would daily propound to our ſelves this noble pattern for our imitation and make it our buſineſs, our work, our heaven, to write after this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Copy that Chriſt hath ſet us, <hi>viz.</hi> To be much with God alone. Certainly Chriſtianity is nothing elſe but an imitation of the divine nature, a reducing of a mans ſelf to the Image of God, in which he was created, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. A Chriſtians whole life ſhould be nothing but a viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Chriſt. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had this notion amongſt them (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> reports) That the wayes to honour their gods was to be like them. Sure I am, that the higheſt wayes of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, is to be like to Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk, even as he walked.</hi> Oh that this bleſſed Scripture might alwayes lye warm upon our hearts. Chriſt is the Sun, and all the watches of our lives
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40722:67"/> ſhould be ſet by the Dial of his motion. Chriſt is a pattern of pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns; his example ſhould be to us in ſtead of a thouſand examples. 'Tis not only our liberty, but our duty and glory to follow Chriſt in all his moral vertues abſolutely: other patterns be imperfect and defective, but Chriſt is a perfect pattern; and of all his Children they are the happieſt that come neareſt to this perfect pattern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> loved his Children the better for reſembling him in ſin: But Chriſt loves his children the more for reſembling him in ſanctity. I have read of ſome Springs that change the colour of the Cattel that drink of them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the colour of their own waters, as <hi>Du Bartus</hi> ſings.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Cerona, Xanth and Cephiſus do make</l>
                  <l>The thirſty flocks, that of their waters take,</l>
                  <l>Black, Red and White, and near the Crimſon deep,</l>
                  <l>The Arabian Fountain maketh Crimſon ſheep.</l>
               </lg>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40722:68"/>
               <p> Certainly, Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a Fountain, in which whoſoever bathes, and of which whoſoever drinks, ſhall be changed into the ſame likeneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <q>But why was our Lord Jeſus ſo much <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> in private prayer, why was he ſo often with God alone?</q>
               <p>Firſt, 'Twas to put a very high <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> honour and value upon private prayer; 'twas to enhance and raiſe the price of this duty. Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are very apt and prone to have low, and under-valuing thoughts of ſecret prayer. But Chriſt by exerciſing himſelf ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in it, hath put an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour, and an ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon it. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, He was much in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, he was often with God alone, that he might not be ſeen of men, and that he might avoid all ſhews and appearances of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and popular applauſe. He that hath commanded us to abſtain
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40722:68"/> from all appearance of evil, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. would not himſelf, when he was in this world, venture upon the leaſt appearance of evil. Chriſt was very ſhie of every thing that did but look like ſin; he was very ſhie of the very ſhew and ſhadow of pride or vain-glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To avoid interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the duty. Secreſie is no ſmall advantage to the ſerious and lively carrying on of a private duty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions and diſturbances from without are often-times quench-coals to private prayer. The beſt Chriſtians do but bungle when they meet with interruptions in their private devotions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To ſet us ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pattern and gracious example, that we ſhould never pleaſe nor content our ſelves with publick-prayers onely, nor with family-prayers only, but that we ſhould alſo apply our ſelves to ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to cloſet prayer. Chriſt was not alwayes in publick, nor alwayes in his family, but he was often in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40722:69"/> with God alone, that by his own example he might encourage us to be often with God in ſecret; and happy are they that tread in his ſteps, and that write after his Copy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That he might approve himſelf to our underſtandings and conſciences to be a moſt juſt and faithful High-Prieſt. Chriſt was <note place="margin">

And now he is in Heaven, he is ſtill a making Interceſſion for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, To convince us that his Father hears and obſerves our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers, and bottles up all our ſecret tears, and that he is not a ſtranger to our cloſet deſires, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, breathings, hungrings and thirſtings.</p>

               <p> Thirdly, Conſider, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exerciſing of your ſelves in ſecret prayer, is that which will difference and diſtinguiſh you from hypocrites, who do all they do to be ſeen of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>Take heed that you do not your alms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, to be ſeen of them; otherwiſe ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doeſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">They ſay of the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale that when ſhe is ſolitary in the woods ſhe is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of her note, but com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſes her ſelf more quaintly and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives there be any audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or if ſhe be near houſes. Juſt ſo 'tis with hypocrites in religious duties.</note> 
                  <hi>thine alms, do not ſound a Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, as the hypocrites do in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and in the ſtreets, that they may have glory of men. Verily, I ſay unto you, they have their reward.</hi> Self is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyl that makes the Chariot-wheels of the hypocrite move in all religious concernments. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>And when thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to ſtand praying in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeen of men: Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward.</hi> Verſ. 16. <hi>Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a ſad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto men to faſt. Verily I ſay unto</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40722:70"/> 
                  <hi>you, they have their reward.</hi> Thus you ſee that theſe hypocrites look more at men, that at God in all their duties. When they give alms, the trumpet muſt ſound; when they pray, it muſt be in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and in the corner of the ſtreets; and when they faſted, they disfigured their faces, that they might appear unto men to faſt. Hypocrites live upon the praiſes and applauſes of men. Naturaliſts report of the <hi>Chelydonian</hi> ſtone, that it will retain its vertue no longer than it is encloſed in gold. So hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites will keep up their duties no longer than they are fed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and encloſed with the golden praiſes and applauſes of men. Hypocrites are like blazing Stars, which ſo long as they are fed with Vapours, ſhine as if they were fixed Stars; but let the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours dry up, and preſently they vaniſh and diſappear.</p>
               <p>Cloſet duty ſpeaks out moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. He prayes with a witneſs that prayes without a witneſs.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40722:70"/> The more ſincere the ſoul is, the more in Cloſet duty the ſoul will be, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 33. Where do you read in all the Scripture, that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Demas,</hi> or <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> or the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, did ever uſe to pour out their ſouls before the Lord in ſecret? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer is not the Hypocrites ordinary walk, his ordinary work or trade. There is great cauſe to fear that his heart was never right with God, whoſe whole devotion is ſpent among men, or among many: Or elſe our Saviour in drawing the hypocrites picture, would never have made this to be the very caſt of his countenance, as he doth in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5. 'Tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that Chriſt commands his Diſciples, that they ſhould not be as the hypocrites. 'Tis one thing to be hypocrites, and 'tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be as the hypocrites. Chriſt would not have his people to look like hypocrites, nor to be like to hypocrites. 'Tis only ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that will enable a man to make
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40722:71"/> a trade of private prayer. In pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with many, there are many things that may bribe and provoke a carnal heart, as pride, vain-glory, love of applauſe, or to get a name. An hypocrite in all his duties trades more for a good name, than for a good life, for a good report than for a good conſcience; like Fidlers, that are more careful in tuning their Inſtruments, than in compoſing their lives. But in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, there is no ſuch trade to be driven. But,</p>

            <div n="4" type="argument">
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret we may more freely and fully, and ſafely unboſome our ſoules to God, than we can in the preſence of many or a few. Hence the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is to mourn apart, and the Wife apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 12, 13, 14. not only to ſhew the ſoundneſs of their ſorrow, but alſo to ſhew their ſincerity by their ſecreſie; they muſt mourn apart that their ſins may not be diſcloſed nor diſcovered one to another: Here they are ſevered to ſhew that they wept not for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

In ſecret a Chriſtian may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into ſuch particulars, as in publick or before others he wil not, he may not, he ought not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

There are many ſins which many men have fallen into before converſion and ſince converſion, which ſhould they be known to the world, would make themſelves to ſtink, and Religion to ſtink, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to ſtink in the noſtrils of all that know them. Yea, ſhould thoſe weakneſſes and wickedneſſes be publiſhed upon the houſe tops, which many are guilty of before grace received, or ſince grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;

'Tis an infinite mercy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in God, to lay a Law of reſtraint upon Satan, who elſe would be the greateſt Blab in all the world: It would be mirth and muſick to him to be ſtill a laying open the follies and weakneſſes of the Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> brings in the Devil boaſting againſt Chriſt, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging <hi>Judas</hi> as his own. <hi>He is not thine, Lord Jeſus, he is mine, his thoughts beat for me; he eats with thee, but is fed by me; he takes bread from thee, but mony from me; he drinks with thee, and ſells thy blood to me.</hi> There is not a ſin that a Saint commits,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40722:72"/> but Satan would trumpet it out to all the world, if God would but give him leave. No man that is in his right wits, will lay open to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his bodily infirmities, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, diſeaſes, ailments griefs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to ſome near relation, or boſom friend, or able Phyſitian.

When a chriſtian is in a Wilderneſs (which is a very ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place) then God delights to ſpeak friendly &amp; comfortably to him. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Behold, I will allure her and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or comfortably to her.</hi> Or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it, <hi>I will ſpeak to her heart.</hi> When I have her alone, ſaith. God, in a ſolitary wilderneſs, I will ſpeak ſuch things to her heart, as ſhall exceedingly cheer her, and comfort her, and even make her heart leap and dance within her. A Husband imparts his mind moſt freely and fully to his wife when ſhe is alone; and ſo doth Chriſt to the believing ſoul. O the ſecret kiſſes! the ſecret embraces! the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret viſits! the ſecret whiſpers! the ſecret chearings! the ſecret ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! the ſecret diſcoveries! <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that God gives to his people when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40722:78"/> alone, when in a hole, when under the ſtaires, when behind the door, when in a dungeon! When <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33. 1, 2, 3.</note> was calling upon God alone in his dark dungeon, he had great and wonderful things ſhew'd him that he knew not of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>I am never leſſe alone, than when I am all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for then I can enjoy the preſence of my God moſt freely, fully, and ſweetly; without interruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'twas a moſt ſweet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſaying of <hi>Bernard, O Saint, knoweſt thou not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thy Husband Chriſt is baſhful, and will not be familiar in company: Retire thy ſelf therefore by Prayer and Meditation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Cloſet, or the Fields, and there thou ſhalt have Chriſts embraces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman being at pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer and meditation in her Parlour, had ſuch ſweet, choice, and full enjoyments of God, that ſhe cried out, <hi>Oh that I might ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this ſweet communion with God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Chriſt loves to embrace his Spouſe, not ſo much in the open ſtreet, as in a cloſet: And certainly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40722:79"/> the gracious ſoul hath never ſweeter views of glory, than when it is moſt out of the view of the world. Wiſe men give their beſt, their choiſeſt, and their richeſt gifts in ſecret; and ſo doth Chriſt give his the beſt of the beſt, when they are in a corner, when they are all alone. But, as for ſuch as cannot ſpare time to ſeek God in a Cloſet, to ſerve him in ſecret, they ſufficiently manifeſt that they have little fellowſhip or friendſhip with God, whom they ſo ſeldome come at.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, Conſider, the time of this life is the only time for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer. Heaven will admit of no ſecret prayer.

               <p>Eighthly, Conſider, the great prevalency of ſecret prayer. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer is <hi>(Porta Coeli, Clavis Paradiſi)</hi> the Gate of Heaven, a Key to let us into Paradiſe. Oh the great things that private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath done with God! Oh the <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 22</note> great mercies that have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by private prayer! And, oh <note place="margin">Pſal. 38. 8.</note> the great threatnings that have been diverted by private prayer! And, oh the great judgements that have been removed by private prayer! And, oh the great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been prevented by private prayer! I have read of a malitious woman who gave her ſelf to the Devil, provided that he would do a miſchief to ſuch a neighbour, whom ſhe mortally
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40722:80"/> hated: The Devil went again and again to do his errand, but at laſt he returns and tells her, that he could do no hurt to that man, for when ever he came, he found him either reading the Scriptures, or at private prayer. Private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pierces the Heavens, and are commonly bleſt and loaded with gracious and glorious returns from thence. Whilſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weeping in private, God ſent the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to him to aſſure him, that his prayer was heard, and that his tears were ſeen, and that he would add unto his dayes fifteen years. So when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was all alone meditating and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Iſa. 38. 5.</note> and treating with God for a good wife in the fields, he meets <hi>Robckah.</hi> So <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 25, <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 63 64.</note> 26, 27, 28. <hi>And Jacob was left alone: and there wreſtled a man with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the breaking of the day. And when he ſaw that he prevailed not againſt him he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacobs thigh was out of joynt, as he wreſtled with him. And he</hi>

                  <hi>ſaid, let me go, for the day breaketh; and he ſaid, I will not let thee goe except thou bleſs me. And he ſaid unto him, what is thy name? and he ſaid, Jacob. And he ſaid, thy name ſhall be called no more Jacob, but Iſrael; for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and with men, and haſt prevailed.</hi> In this Scripture we have an elegant deſcription of a Duel fought between the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and in it there are theſe things moſt obſervable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We have the Combatants or Duelliſts, <hi>Jacob</hi> and God, who appeared in the ſhape or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a man. He that is here ſaid to be a man, was the Son of God in humane ſhape, as it appeareth by the whole narration, and by <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5. Now that this man that wreſtled with <hi>Jacob,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God, and not really man, is moſt evident by theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Jacob</hi> deſires a bleſſing from him; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. Now it is Gods Prerogative royal to bleſſe, and not angels nor mens. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He calls him by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40722:81"/> name of God; <hi>thou haſt power with God,</hi> Verſ. 28. And, ſaith <hi>Jacob, I have ſeen God face to face,</hi> Verſ. 30. Not that he ſaw the Majeſty and Eſſence of God, for no man can ſee the eſſential glory of God and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 20, 23. but he ſaw God more apparently, more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, more gloriouſly than ever he had done before. Some created ſhape, ſome glimpſe of glory <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaw, whereby God was pleaſed for the preſent to teſtifie his more immediate preſence; but not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſame perſon that here <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtles with, is he whom <hi>Jacob</hi> remembreth (in his benediction) as his deliverer from all evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. 'Twas that God that appeared to him at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> when he fled from the face of his Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 7. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Jacob</hi> is reproved for his curious enquiring or asking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Angels name, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. which is a clear argument or demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his majeſty and glory, God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40722:81"/> being above all notion and Name. God is a ſuper ſubſtantial ſubſtance, an underſtanding not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, a word never to be ſpoken. One being asked, What God was, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionyſ. Areop. de Divin. Nom. cap.</hi> 1.</note> anſwered, <hi>That he muſt be God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before he could know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God fully.</hi> We are as well able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Sea in a Cockle-ſhel, as we are able to comprehend the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty (or that <hi>Nomen Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> phraſeth it.) <hi>In ſearching after God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom) I am like a man digging in a deep ſpring; I ſtand here, and the water riſeth upon me; and I ſtand there, and ſtill the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riſeth upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this conflict you have not one man wreſtling with another, nor one man wreſtling with a created Angel, but a poor weak mortal man wreſtling with an immortal God, weakneſs wreſtling with Strength and a finite being with an infinite Being. Though <hi>Jacob</hi> had no ſecond though he was all alone, though he was wonderfully over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match't, yet he wreſtles and keeps
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40722:82"/> his hold; and all in the ſtrength of him he wreſtles with.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You have the place where they combated, and that was beſide the Ford <hi>Jabbok, verſ.</hi> 22. (This is the name of a Brook or River, ſpringing by <hi>Rabba,</hi> the Metropolis of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> &amp; iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing into <hi>Jordan</hi> beneath the Sea of <hi>Galilce, Numb.</hi> 21. 24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 13, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 16.) <hi>Jacob</hi> did never enjoy ſo much of the preſence of God, as when he had left the company of men. O! the ſweet communion that <hi>Jacob</hi> had with God when he was retired from his family, and was all alone with his God by the Ford <hi>Jabbok.</hi> Certainly <hi>Jacob</hi> was never leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone than at this time, when he was ſo alone. Saints often meet with the beſt wine, and with the ſtrongeſt cordials, when they are all alone with God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You have the time of the Combate, and that was the Night: At what time of the night this wreſtling, this duel began, we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40722:82"/> no where read; but it laſted till break of day, it laſted till <hi>Jacob</hi> had the better of the Angel. How many hours of the night this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict laſted, no mortal man can tell. Gods deſign was that none ſhould be ſpectators nor witneſſes of this combat, but <hi>Jacob</hi> only, and therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt be wreſtling when others were ſleeping.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You have the ground of the Quarrel, and that was <hi>Jacobs</hi> fear of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and his importunate deſire for a bleſſing. <hi>Jacob</hi> flies to God that he might not fall before man; he flies to God that he might not fly before men. In a ſtorm there is no ſhelter like to the wing of God. He is ſafeſt, and happieſt, and wiſeſt, that lays himſelf under divine protection. This <hi>Jacob</hi> knew, and therefore he runs to God, as to his only City of refuge. In this conflict God would have given out; <hi>Let me go, for the day breaketh, verſ.</hi> 26. but <hi>Jacob</hi> keeps his hold, and tells him boldly to his very face, that he would not let him go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40722:83"/> he would bleſs him. O the power of private prayer! it hath a kind of omnipotency in it, it takes God captive, it holds him as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, it binds the hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; yea, it will wring a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, a bleſſing out of the hand of Heaven it ſelf. O the power of that prayer that makes a man victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over the greateſt, the higheſt Power. <hi>Jacob</hi> though a man, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man, a travelling man, a tired man, yea, though a worm (that is eaſily cruſht and trodden under <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 14.</note> foot) and no man, yet in private prayer, he is ſo potent, that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Omnipotent God, he is ſo mighty that he overcomes the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You have the nature or manner of the Combate; and that was both outward and inward, both corporal and ſpiritual; 'Twas by might and ſlight; 'twas as well by the ſtrength of his body, as 'twas by the force of his Faith. He wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only with ſpiritual ſtrugl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tears and prayers, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40722:83"/> but with corporal alſo, wherein God aſſayled him with one hand, and upheld him with the other. In this conflict, <hi>Jacob</hi> and the Angel of the Covenant did really lay arm on arm, and ſet ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and put foot to foot, and uſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlights &amp; wayes as men do that wreſtle one with another. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is here rendred <hi>wreſtled,</hi> ſignifies the raiſing of the duſt, becauſe thoſe which did wreſtle of old, did not only wreſtle naked (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then was) but did alſo uſe to caſt duſt one upon another, that ſo they might take more ſure hold one of another. Some from this word <hi>Abak,</hi> do conclude that <hi>Jacob</hi> and the Angel did tug, and ſtrive, and turn each other till they ſweat again; for ſo much the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. <hi>Jacob</hi> and the Angel did not wreſtle in jeſt, but in good earneſt; they wreſtled with their might (as it were) for the Garland; they ſtrove for victory as for life.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40722:84"/>
               <p> But as this wreſtling was corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo 'twas ſpiritual alſo; <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſoul takes hold of God, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> faith takes hold of God, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> prayers takes hold of God, and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> tears takes hold of God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4, 5. Certainly <hi>Jacobs</hi> weapons in this warfare were mainly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and ſo mighty through God. There is no overcoming of God but in his own ſtrength. <hi>Jacob</hi> did more by his royal faith, than he did by his noble hands, and more by weeping than he did by ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more by praying than he did by all his bodily ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, You have the iſſue of the Combate, and that is Victory over the Angel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtles in the Angels arms and armour, and ſo overcomes him; as a Prince he over-powers the Angel, by that very power he had from the Angel. The Angel was as freely and fully willing to be conquered by <hi>Jacob,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> was willing to be conquerour. When
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40722:84"/> Lovers wreſtle, the ſtrongeſt is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to take a fall of the weakeſt; and ſo 'twas here. The Father in wreſtling with his Child is willing enough, for his childs comfort and encouragement, to take a fall now and then; and ſo 'twas between the Angel and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in the preſent caſe. Now in this bleſſed ſtory, as in a Chryſtal-glaſs, you may ſee the great power and prevalency of private prayer; it conquers the great Conquerour; it is ſo omnipotent, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an omnipotent God.</p>
               <p>Now this you may ſee more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſweetly cleared up in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3, 4. <hi>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his ſtrength he had power with God: Yea, he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Angel, and prevailed: he wept and made ſupplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he ſpake with us.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> was all alone, and in a dark night, and but on one leg, yet then he play'd the Prince with God (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) <hi>Jacob</hi> by prayers and tears
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40722:85"/> did ſo prince it with God, as that he carried the bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was by weeping, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing by praying. Prayers and tears are not only very pleaſing to God, but alſo very prevalent with God. And thus you ſee that this great inſtance of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſpeaks out aloud the prevalency of private prayer.</p>
               <p>See another inſtance of this in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 6. 6, 8, 9. <hi>I am weary groanings: all the night make I my bed to ſwim: I water my couch with my tears.</hi> Theſe are all exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive figurative ſpeeches, to ſet forth the greatneſs of his ſorrow and the multitude of his tears. <hi>David</hi> in his retirement makes the place of his ſin <hi>(viz.</hi> his Bed) to be the place of his repentance. <hi>David</hi> ſins privately upon his bed, and <hi>David</hi> mourns privately upon his bed. Every place which we have pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſin, we ſhould ſanctifie and water with our tears, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40722:85"/> 
                  <hi>weeping.</hi> As blood hath a voice, and as the rod hath a voice, ſo tears have a voice, tears have tongues, and tears can ſpeak. There is no noiſe to that that tears in ſecret make in the ears of God. A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent &amp; indulgent Father, can better pick out the wants and neceſſities of his Children by their ſecret tears than by their loud complaints, by their weeping than by their words; and do you think that God can't do as much. Tears are not alwayes Mutes. <hi>Cry aloud</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>not with thy tongue, but with thy eyes;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>not with thy words, but with thy tears; for that is the prayer that maketh the moſt forcible entry into the ears of the great God of Heaven.</hi> Penitent tears are undeniable Ambaſſadors, that never return from the Throne of Grace, without a gracious anſwer. Tears are a kind of ſilent prayers, which though they ſay nothing, yet they obtain pardon; and though they plead not a mans cauſe, yet they obtain mercy at the hands of God. As you ſee in that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40722:86"/> of <hi>Peter,</hi> who though he ſaid nothing (that we read of) yet, weeping bitterly, he obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 75.</note> I have read of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who coming as a Viſitant to the houſe of a ſick man, he ſaw the room full of friends and kindred, who were all ſilent, yet all weeping; the Wife ſobbing, the Children ſighing, the Kinsfolk lamenting, all mourning; whereupon <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> uttered this ſhort ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayer, <hi>Lord, What prayer doſt thou hear if not theſe?</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>The Lord hath heard my ſupplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.</hi> God ſometimes anſwers his people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pray, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe, that before they call, I will anſwer.</hi> And ſometimes <hi>while they are praying;</hi> ſo it follows in the ſame verſe, <hi>And while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 19. <hi>He will be very gracious unto thee, at the voice of thy cry; when he ſhall hear it, he will anſwer thee.</hi> And ſometimes after they have prayed; as the experiences of all Chriſtians
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40722:86"/> can teſtifie. Sometimes God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hears nor receives a prayer; and this is the common caſe and lot of the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>Job</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. Sometimes God hears the prayers of his people, but doth not preſently anſwer them, as in that caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. And ſometimes God both hears and receives the prayers of his people, as here he did <hi>Davids.</hi> Now in this inſtance of <hi>David</hi> as in a glaſſe, you may run and read the prevalency of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, and of ſecret tears.</p>
               <p>You may take another inſtance of this in <hi>Jonah, Jonah</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10. <hi>Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fiſhes belly, and ſaid, I cried by reaſon of my affliction, unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of Hell cried I, and thou heardeſt my voice. For thou had'ſt caſt me into the deep, into the midſt of the ſeas, and the floods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, all thy billows and thy waves paſſed over me. The waters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, even to the ſoul: the</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40722:87"/> 
                  <hi>depth cloſed me round about, the weeds were wrapt about my head. When my ſoul fainted within me, I remembred the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy Temple. And the Lord ſpake unto the fiſh, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</hi> When <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was all alone, and in the midſt of many dangers and deaths; when he was in the Whales belly, yea, in the belly of Hell (ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe horrid and hideous, deep and diſmal) yet then private prayer fetches him from thence. Let a mans dangers be never ſo many, nor never ſo great, yet ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath a certain omnipotency in it, that wil deliver him out of them all. In multiplied afflictions private prayer is moſt prevalent with God. In the very midſt of drowning, ſecret prayer will keep both head and heart above water. Upon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi> private prayer, God ſends forth his <hi>Mandamus,</hi> and the Fiſh ſerves <hi>Jonah</hi> for a ſhip to ſail ſafe to ſhore. When the caſe is even deſperate, yet then private prayer can do

               <p>O ſirs, God reveals himſelf, and his mind, and will, and truth, to his people in a more friendly and familiar way, than he doth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11. <hi>And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, unto you 'tis given to know the myſtery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all theſe things are done in parables.</hi> Luke 8. 10. <hi>And he ſaid, unto you it is given to know the myſtery of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that ſeeing they might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand.</hi> Though great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and profound Clerks, and deep ſtudied, but unſanctified Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, may know much of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend much the doctrines of the Goſpel, and diſpute much for the doctrines of the Goſpel, and glory
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40722:97"/> much in the doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and take a great deal of pains to dreſs and trim up the doctrines of the Goſpel, with the flowers of Rhetorick or Eloquence; though it be much better to preſent truth in her native plainneſs, than to hang her ears with counterfeit Pearls (the Word, without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane adornments, is like the ſtone <hi>Garamantides,</hi> that hath drops of gold in it ſelf, ſufficient to enrich the believing ſoul) Yet the ſpecial, ſpiritual, powerful, and ſaving <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 25. 1 Cor. 2. 7.</note> knowledge of the doctrines of the Goſpel, is a ſecret, a myſtery, yea, a hidden myſtery to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> compares the myſtery of Chriſt, in regard of the wicked, to a written book, that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant can neither read nor ſpell; he fees the cover, the leaves, and the letters, but he underſtands not the meaning of what he ſees. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares, the myſtery of Grace to an indited Epiſtle, which an unskilful Ideot viewing, he cannot read it, he cannot underſtand it; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40722:98"/> it is paper and ink, but the ſenſe, the matter, he knows not, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not. So unſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though they are never ſo learned, and though they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bark of the myſtery of Chriſt, yet they perceive not, they underſtand not the myſtery of grace, the inward ſenſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the bleſſed Scriptures. Though the Devil be the greateſt Scholar in the world, and though he have more learning than all the men in the world have, yet there are many thouſand ſecrets and myſteries in the Goſpel of grace, that he knows not really, ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, feelingly, efficaciouſly, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, throughly, ſavingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O but now Chriſt makes known himſelf, his mind, his grace, his truth, to his people, in a more clear, full, familiar and friendly way, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>For thou, O Lord of hoſts, God of Iſrael, haſt revealed to thy ſervant;</hi> ſo you read it in your Books: but in the Hebrew it is thus, <hi>Lord, thou haſt revealed this to the ear</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40722:98"/> 
                  <hi>of thy ſervant.</hi> Now the emphaſis lieth in that word, <hi>to the ear,</hi> which is left out in your Books. When God makes known himſelf to his people, he revealeth things to their ear, as we uſe to do to a friend, who is intimate with us, we ſpeak a thing to his ear. There is many a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in the eares of his ſervants, which others never come to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſix ſeveral gradations that are in this Scripture are worthy of our moſt ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Knowledge. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The knowledge of the glory of God. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God. And,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Shining. And,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Shining into our hearts. And,</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:40722:99"/>
               <p> Sixthly, Shining into our hearts in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee that the Lord reveals the ſecrets of himſelf, his kingdome, his truth, his grace, his glory to his ſaints. But.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are the ſecrets of his favour, the ſecrets of his ſpecial love, that he bears to them, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret purpoſes of his heart to ſave them, and theſe are thoſe great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, thoſe deep things of God, which none can reveal but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Now theſe great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, theſe deep things of God, God doth reveal to his people by his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> Now what are the things
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40722:99"/> that are freely given to us of God, but our election, vocation, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſanctification, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? And why hath God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us his Spirit, but that we ſhould know the things that are freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us of God. Some by <hi>ſecret,</hi> in that 25th. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a particular aſſurance of Gods favour, whereby happineſs is ſecured to us both for the preſent and for the future; they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>ſecret,</hi> the ſealing of the Spirit, the hidden Manna, the White Stone, and the New Name in it, <hi>which none knoweth but he that hath it.</hi> And ſo much thoſe words, <hi>He will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> ſeems to import; for what greater ſecret can God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to his people, than that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Covenant of grace to them in its freeneſs, fulneſs, ſureneſs, ſweetneſs, ſuitableneſs, everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in ſealing up his good pleaſure, and all the ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings of the Covenant to them? Such as love and ſerve
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40722:100"/> the Lord, ſhall be of his Cabinet Counſel, they ſhall know his ſoul ſecrets, and be admitted into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious familiarity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21, 22, 23 <hi>He that hath my commandements and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him. Judas ſaith unto him, not Iſcariot: Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the world? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, if any man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi> God and Chriſt will keep houſe with them, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the ſecrets of their love to them that are obſervant of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And thus you ſee that the Saints are the onely perſons to whom God will reveal the ſecrets of his Providence, the ſecrets of his Kingdom, and the ſecrets of his Love unto. Chriſt came out of the boſom of his father, and he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens all the ſecrets of his father
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40722:100"/> only to his boſom friends. Now what an exceeding high honour is it for God to open the ſecrets of his love, the ſecrets of his promiſes, the ſecrets of his providences, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his counſels, and the ſecrets of his covenant to his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> thought no man fit to know his ſecrets. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians</hi> none but noble Men, Lords and Dukes, might be made partakers of State ſecrets; they eſteeming ſecrecy a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, a Divine thing; as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> affirms. But now ſuch honour God hath put upon all his Saints, as to make them Lords, and Nobles, and the only privy-ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Court of Heaven. The higheſt honour and glory that earthly Princes can put upon their ſubjects is to communicate to them their greateſt ſecrets. Now this high honour and glory, the King of kings hath put upon his people; <hi>For his ſecrets are with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> 'Twas a high honour to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40722:101"/> that he could tell the ſecrets <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 12.</note> that were ſpoken in the Kings bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. O what an honour muſt it then be for the Saints to know the ſecrets that are ſpoken in the preſence-chamber of the King of Kings.</p>
               <p>Now I appeale to the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all that fear the Lord, whether it be not a juſt, equal, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and neceſſary thing, that the people of God ſhould freely and fully lay open all the ſecrets of their hearts before the Lord, who hath thus highly honoured them, as to reveale the ſecrets of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, kingdome and favour to them? Yea, I appeale to all ſerious and ingenious Chriſtians, whether it be not againſt the light and law of nature, and againſt the law of love, and law of friendſhip, to be reſerved and cloſe, yea, to hide our ſecrets from him, who reveales his greateſt and his choiceſt ſecrets to us? And if it be, why then do not you in ſecret, lay open all your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, and ſecret wants, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40722:101"/> deſires, ſecret feares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to him that ſeeth in ſecret? You know all ſecrets, are to be communicated only in ſecret: none but fooles in <hi>Folio</hi> will communicate ſecrets upon a ſtage, or before many. But,</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, that in times of great ſtraits and trials, in times of great afflictions and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, private prayer is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans meat &amp; drink; 'tis his cheif city of refuge; 'tis his ſhelter and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in a ſtormy day.

When <hi>Eſau</hi> came forth with hoſtil intentions againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſecret prayer was <hi>Jacobs</hi> refuge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. <hi>And the meſſengers returned to Jacob, ſaying, we came to thy brother Eſau, and alſo he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</hi> All cut-throates. <hi>Then</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40722:102"/> 
                  <hi>Jacab was greatly afraid, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and he devided the people that was with him, and the flocks and heards, and the camels into two bands. And ſaid, if Eſau come to the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and ſmite it, then the other company which is left ſhall eſcape.</hi> When all is at ſtake 'tis chriſtian prudence to ſave what we can, though we cannot ſave what we would. <hi>And Jacob ſaid, O God of my Father Abraham and God of my Father Iſaac; the Lord which ſaidſt unto me, return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deale well with thee.</hi> Promiſes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate muſt be prayed over; God loves to ſued upon his own bond when he and his People are alone. <hi>Deliver me, I pray thee,</hi> from the <hi>hand of my brother, front the hand of Eſau: for I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the Mother with the children;</hi> or, upon the children, meaning; he he will put all to death. Some look upon the words to be a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from Fowlers, who kill and take away the young and the Dams together; contrary to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40722:102"/> that old law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 6.

When <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all that was near and dear unto him, were in eminent danger of being cut off by <hi>Eſau,</hi> and thoſe men of blood that were with him, he betakes himſelf to private prayer as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City of refuge, againſt the rage and malice of the mighty. And ſo when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was in a ſolitary and loathſome Dungeon, Private prayer was his meat and drink, it was his only City of refuge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Moreover, the word of Lord came unto Jeremiah the ſecond time (while he was yet ſhut up in the Court of the priſon) ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord the Maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to eſtabliſh it, the Lord is his Name: Call unto me, and I will anſwer</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40722:103"/> 
                  <hi>thee, &amp; I will ſhew thee great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (or hidden) <hi>things, which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not.</hi> When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was in a loneſome loathſome. Priſon, God encourages him by private prayer, to ſeek for further diſcoveries and revelations of thoſe choice and ſingular favours, which in future times he purpoſed to confer upon his people. So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the Captains of the Hoſt of the King of Aſſyria, which took Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters</hi> (or chains) <hi>and carried him to Babylon. And when he was in affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him, and heard his ſupplication, and brought him again to Jeruſalem into his Kingdome. Then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord he was God.</hi> When <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was in fetters, in his enemies country, when he was ſtript of all his Princely glory, and led captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he betakes himſelf to Private prayer,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40722:103"/> as his only City of refuge; and by this means he prevailes with God for his reſtauration to his Crown and Kingdome. Private prayer is a City of refuge that no power nor Policy, no craft nor cruelty, no violence nor force is ever able to ſurprize. Though the joynt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the People of God together were often obſtructed and hindered in the times of the ten Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they were never able to obſtruct or hinder ſecret prayer, Private prayer. When men and Devils have done their worſt, every Chriſtian will be able to maintain his Private trade with Heaven. Private prayer will ſhelter a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian againſt all the National, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical, and Perſonal ſtormes and tempeſts, that may threaten him. When a man is lying upon a ſick bed alone, or when a man is in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alone, or when a man is with <hi>Job</hi> left upon the Dunghil alone, or when a man is with <hi>John</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Teſtimony of Jeſus into this or that Iſland alone, O then
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40722:104"/> private prayer will be his meat and drink, his ſhelter, his hiding place, his Heaven. When all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trades faile, this Trade of private Prayer will hold good. But.</p>

We cannot ſigh out a prayer in ſecret, but he ſees us; we cannot lift up our eyes to him at midnight, but he obſerves us. The eye that God hath upon his people when they are in ſecret, is ſuch a ſpecial tender eye of love, as opens his ear, his heart, and his hand, for their good, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are open unto their prayers;</hi> or, as the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it, <hi>his ears are unto their prayers.</hi> If their prayers are ſo faint, that they cannot reach up as high as Heaven, then God will bow the heavens <note place="margin">God is, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus oculus,</hi> all eye.</note> and come down to their prayers.

As a Chriſtian is never out of the reach of Gods hand, ſo he is never out of the view of Gods eye. If a Chriſtian cannot hide himſelf from the Sun, which is Gods Miniſter of light; how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible will it be to hide himſelf from him, whoſe eyes are ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times brighter than the Sun?

'Tis certain, that private duties fit the ſoul for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ordinances.

               <p>19thly, Conſider, that Satan is a very great enemy to ſecret prayer. Secret prayer is a ſcourge, a hell, to Satan; every ſecret prayer adds to the Devils torment, and every ſecret ſigh adds to his torment, and every ſecret groan adds to his torment, &amp; every ſecret tear adds to his torment. When a child of God is on his knees in his ſecret addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">There is no one thing that many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have more ſadly lamented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, as many ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can witneſs, than the ſad inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that they have met with from Satan, when they have been with God alone in a room, in a corner. O! how often have they been ſcared, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by noyſes &amp; ſtrange appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at leaſt to their fancies, when they have been alone with God in a corner.</note> to God, O the ſtrange thoughts, the earthly thoughts, the wandring thoughts, the diſtracted thoughts, the hideous thoughts, the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts, that Satan often injects into his ſoul! and all to wean him from ſecret prayer, and to weary him of ſecret prayer. Sometimes he tells the ſoul, that 'tis in vain to ſeek God in ſecret;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40722:113"/> and at other times he tells the ſoul 'tis too late to ſeek God in ſecret, for the door of mercy is ſhut, and there is no hope, no help for the ſoul: Sometimes he tells the ſoul, that 'tis enough to ſeek God in Publick; and at other times he tells the ſoul, that 'tis but a preciſe trick to ſeek the Lord in private: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he tells the ſoul, that 'tis not elected, and therefore all his ſecret prayers ſhall be rejected; and at other times he tells the ſoul, that 'tis ſealed up unto the day of wrath and therefore ſecret prayer can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reverſe that ſeal: and all this to diſhearten and diſcourage a poor Chriſtian in his ſecret retirements. Sometimes Satan will object to a poor Chriſtian, the greatneſs of his ſins; &amp; at other times he will object againſt a Chriſtian, the greatneſs of his unworthyneſs: Sometimes he will object againſt a Chriſtian his want of grace; and at other times he will object againſt a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian his want of gifts to manage ſuch a duty, as it ſhould be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:

O the ſtrange fears fancies, and conceits, that Satan often raiſes in the ſpirits of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when they are alone with God in a corner; and all to work them to caſt off private prayer. 'Tis none of Satans leaſt deſignes, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a Chriſtian in his private trade with God. Satan watches all a Chriſtians motions; ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn into his cloſet, nor creep into any hole to converſe privately with his God, but he followes him hard at heels, &amp; will be ſtil injecting one thing or another into the ſoul, or elſe objecting one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Chriſtian is as well able to tell the ſtars of

Now from that great oppoſition that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan makes againſt private prayer, a Chriſtian may ſafely conclude theſe five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The excellency of private prayer. Certainly, If it were not an excellent thing, for a man to be in ſecret with God, Satan would never make ſuch head againſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The neceſſity of this duty. The more neceſſary any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to the internal and eternal welfare of a Chriſtian, the more Satan will beſtir himſelf, to blunt a Chriſtians Spirit in that duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The utility or profit that attends a conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this duty. Where we are like to gain moſt, there Satan loves to oppoſe moſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The prevalency of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer. If there were not a kind of an omnipotency in it, if it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40722:114"/> were not able to doe wonders in heaven, and wonders on earth, and wonders in the hearts and lives and wayes of men, Satan would never have ſuch an akeing tooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as he hath.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That God is highly honoured by this duty, or elſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan would never be ſo greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt it. This is certaine, The more Glory God hath from any ſervice we do, the more Satan will ſtrive by all his wiles and ſlights to take us, either off from that ſervice, or ſo to interrupt us in that ſervice, that God may have no honour, nor we no good, nor himſelf no hurt, by our private retirements.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40722:115"/> that hath been done to his ſecret ones. Neither are there any on earth that knowes ſo much of the ſecrets of his love, of the ſecrets of his counſels, of the ſecrets of his purpoſes, of the ſecrets of his heart, as his ſecret ones do.

                  <note place="margin">1 King. 13. 2.</note> Altar, and his burning of the Veſſels that were made for <hi>Baal,</hi> and his pulling down the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Prieſts, whom the Kings of <note place="margin">2 King. 23. 4,—21.</note> 
                  <hi>Judah</hi> had ſet up, and his burning the Grove at the brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> and his ſtamping it to powder, and his breaking down the houſes of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and his defiling of the high places where the Prieſts had burnt incenſe, and his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pieces the Images, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Groves, and filling their places with the bones of men, &amp;c. So <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſignifies <hi>a Saviour,</hi> and his practiſe was anſwerable to his name. Though he could not ſave his people from their ſins, yet he often ſaved them from their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Great and many were the deliverances, the ſalvations, that were inſtrumentally brought about by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as all know that have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40722:117"/> read the book of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> ſignifies <hi>gracious,</hi> and his practiſe was anſwerable to his name; he was ſo gracious in his teachings, and in his walkings, that he gained favour in the very eyes of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. By all theſe Inſtances (and by many more that might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) you ſee that other Saints practiſes have anſwered to their names And therefore let every one of us look that our practiſes do alſo anſwer to our names, that as we are called the Lords ſecret ones, ſo we may be much with God in ſecret, that ſo there may be a bleſſed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between our names and our practiſes, &amp; we may never repent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, that we have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods ſecret ones, his hidden ones, but yet never made conſcience of maintaining ſecret communion with God in our cloſets. And thus you ſee that there are no leſs than Twenty arguments to perſwade you to cloſet prayer, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain private communion with God in a Corner.</p>

            <p> The uſe and Application of all follows.</p>
            <q>Is it ſo that Cloſet Prayer, or Private Prayer, is ſuch an indiſpenſible duty, that Chriſt himſelf hath laid upon all that are not willing to lye under the the woful brand of being hypocrites; then this truth looks very ſourely and ſadly upon theſe five ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</q>
            <p>Firſt, It looks ſourly and ſadly upon all thoſe that put off ſecret prayer, private prayer, till they are moved to it by the Spirit; for by this ſad deluſion, many have been kept from ſecret prayer, many weeks, many moneths, O that I might not ſay, many years! Though it be a very fit ſeaſon to <note place="margin">Iſa. 62. 1. Pſal. 123. 1, 2 Gal. 4. 6.</note> pray when the Spirit moves us to pray, yet, 'tis not the only ſeaſon to pray. He that makes Religion his buſineſs, will pray as daily for daily grace, as he doth pray daily for daily bread. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. <hi>And</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:40722:118"/> 
               <hi>he ſpake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 17. <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing.</hi> Epheſ. 6. 18. <hi>Praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance, and ſupplication for all Saints.</hi> Rom. 12. 12. <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing inſtant in prayer.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> is <note place="margin">

                  </gap> In every ſeaſon, as occaſion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offers it ſelf, we muſt pray.</note> a Metaphor taken from hunting Dogs, that never give over the game till they have got their prey. A Chriſtian muſt not only pray, but hold on in prayer, till he hath got the heavenly prize. We are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes, and therefore we had need be praying alwayes. The world is alwayes alluring, and therefore we had need be alwayes a praying; Satan is alwayes a tempting, and therefore we had need be alwayes a praying; and we are alwayes a ſinning, and therefore we had need be alwayes a praying; and we are in dangers alwayes, and therefore we had need be praying alwayes; and we are dying alwayes, and therefore <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 31</note>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:40722:118"/> we had need be praying alwayes. Mans whole life is but a lingring death; man no ſooner begins to live, but he begins to die. When one was ask't, why he prayed ſix times a day, he only gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>I muſt die, I muſt die, I muſt die.</hi> Dying Chriſtians had need be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, and they that are alwayes a dying had need be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a praying. Certainly, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleſs families are graceleſs fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and prayerleſs perſons are graceleſs perſons. It were better <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 25.</note> ten thouſand times, that we had never been born into the world, than that we ſhould go ſtill-born out of the world. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, This truth looks ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſadly upon thoſe that pray not at all, neither in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies nor in their cloſets. Among all Gods Children, there is not one poſſeſt with a dumb devil. Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons are forſaken of God, blinded by Satan, hardned in ſin, &amp; every breath they draw, liable to all temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40722:119"/> Judgements. Prayer is that part of natural worſhip due to God, which none will deny but ſtark Atheiſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that amongſt the <note place="margin">That wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ought to pray, and the grand objection againſt their prayers anſwered at large in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called <hi>The Crown and glory of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 326. to <hi>pag.</hi> 337.</note> worſt of men, <hi>Turks;</hi> and the worſt of <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> it is a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt any witneſs by their Law, that he hath not prayed ſix times in every natural day, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſual with them to pray ſix times a day.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Before the day-break they pray for day.</item>
               <item>2. When it is day, they give thanks for day.</item>
               <item>3. At noon they thank God for half the day paſt.</item>
               <item>4. After that they pray for a good Sun-ſet.</item>
               <item>5. And after that they thank God for the day paſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And then, ſixthly and laſtly, they pray for a good night after their day.</p>
            <p>Certainly, theſe very <hi>Moors</hi> will one day riſe in judgement againſt them, who caſt off prayer, who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40722:119"/> live in a total neglect of prayer, who ſuffer ſo many Suns and Moons to riſe and ſet upon their heads, without any ſolemn calling upon God. I have read of a man, who being ſick and afraid of death, fell to his prayers; and to move God to hear him, told him, <hi>That he was no common beggar, and that he had never troubled him with his prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heil. Mic. p. 376.</note> 
               <hi>and if he would but hear him at that time, he would never trouble him again.</hi> This world is full of ſuch prophane blaſphemous, atheiſtical wretches. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This truth looks very ſourly and ſadly upon ſuch, who are all for publick prayer, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regard private prayer; who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll for going up to the Temple, but never care for going into their Cloſets. This is moſt palpable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, for a man to be very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for publick prayer, but very cold and careleſs as to private prayer. He that pretends conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the one, and makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the other, is an hypocrite
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40722:120"/> in grain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 5. And the Devil knowes well enough, how to make his markets of all ſuch hypocrites, that are all for the prayers of the Church, but perfect <hi>Gallio's</hi> as to private prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 17. Such as perform all their private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, but not in the Chamber, do put too great a ſlight upon the authority of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy Chamber;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>when thou prayeſt,</hi> Go to the Church; but, <hi>when thou prayeſt, go into thy Chamber.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This truth looks ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſourly upon ſuch, who in their Cloſets pray with a loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous voice. A Chriſtian ſhould ſhut both the door of his Cloſet, and the door of his Lips ſo cloſe, that none ſhould hear without, what he ſaith within. <hi>Enter into thy Cloſet,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray.</hi> But what need a man ſhut his Cloſet door, if he may pray with a clamorous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40722:120"/> voice, if he make ſuch a noiſe as all in the ſtreet, or all in the houſe may hear him. The Hen when ſhe lays her Eggs, gets into a hole, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but then ſhe makes ſuch a noiſe with her cackling, that ſhe tells all in the houſe where ſhe is, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what ſhe is. Such Chriſtians that in their Cloſets do imitate the Hen, do rather pray to be ſeen, heard, and obſerved by men, than out of any noble deſign to glorifie God, or to pour out their ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him <hi>that ſeeth in ſecret.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times children when they are vext, or afraid of the rod, will run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the door, or get into a dark hole, and there they will lye cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſighing, and ſobbing, that all the houſe may know where they are. O 'tis a childiſh thing ſo to cry and ſigh, and ſob, in our Cloſets, as to tell all in the houſe, where we are, and about what work we are: Well Chriſtians for an effectual redreſs of this evil, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſeriouſly conſider of theſe five things.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40722:121"/>
            <p> Firſt, That God ſeeth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God hath a quick ear, and is taken more with the voice of the heart, than he is with the clamour of the mouth. God can eaſily hear the moſt ſecret breathings of thy ſoul. God is more curious in obſerving the meſſages delivered by the heart, than he is thoſe that are only delivered by the mouth. He that prays aloud in private, ſeems to tell others, that God doth not underſtand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret deſires, and thoughts, and workings of his peoples hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, 'Tis not meet, 'tis not convenient, nor expedient, that any ſhould be acquainted with our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayers, but God and our own ſouls. Now 'tis as much our duty to look to what is expedient, as 'tis <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 10, Chap. 12. 1.</note> to look to what is lawful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> So Chap. 10. 23. <hi>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but all things</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40722:121"/> 
               <hi>edifie not.</hi> Now 'tis ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expedient, that 'tis very high folly for men to lay open their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret infirmities unto others, that will rather deride them, than lift up a prayer for them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Loud prayers may be a hinderance and diſturbance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that may be buſied near us, in ſome Religious, or Civil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Hannah</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and yet ſpoke never a word; her heart was full, but her voice was not heard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayes and cries, and yet lets fall never a word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, wherefore cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou unto me? Moſes</hi> did not cry with any audible voice, but with inward ſighs, and ſecret breathings and wreſtlings of ſoul; and theſe inward and ſecret cries, which made no noiſe, carried the day with God; for <hi>Moſes</hi> is heard, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and his people are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. O the prevalency of thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40722:122"/> prayers that make no noiſe in the ears of others.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, This truth looks ſourly and ſadly upon thoſe that do all they can to hinder and diſcourage others from this duty of duties, <hi>Private prayer;</hi> and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by deriding or vilifying of the duty; or elſe, by denying of it to be a duty; or elſe, by their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect of this duty; or elſe, by denying them that are under them time and opportunity for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this duty. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 13. You have a woe pronounced againſt thoſe that will neither goe to Heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer others to goe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into an everlaſting reſt. And ſo I ſay, woe to thoſe Parents, and woe to thoſe Husbands, and woe to theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miſtriſes, that will neither pray in their cloſets themſelves, nor ſuffer their children, nor their wives nor their ſervants, to pour out their ſouls before the Lord in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. O Sirs, how will you anſwer
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40722:122"/> this to your conſciences, when you ſhall lye upon a dying bed and how will you anſwer it to the Judge of all the world, when you ſhall ſtand before a Judgment ſeat! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, all their ſins, and all their neglects, and all their ſpiritual loſſes, that might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by their ſecret prayers, by their cloſet communion with God, will one day be charg'd upon your accounts. And, O that you were all ſo wiſe as to lay theſe things ſo to heart, that you may never hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any that are under your care or charge, from private prayer any more. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, This may ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us, to keep cloſe to our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, to be frequent and conſtant in Private prayer, to be often with God in a corner. The 20 Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations already laid down may ſerve as ſo many motives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke your hearts, to this noble and neceſſary duty.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40722:123"/>
            <p>
               <label>Objection.</label>
            </p>
            <p>But many will be ready to object and ſay, <hi>We have much buſineſs upon our hands, and we cannot ſpare time for private prayer; we have ſo much to doe in our ſhops, and in our ware-houſes, and abroad with others, that we cannot ſpare time to waite upon the Lord in our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <p>Now to this <hi>Objection</hi> I ſhall give theſe Eight Anſwers, that this Objection may never have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection more in any of your hearts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What are all thoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are upon your hands, to thoſe great buſineſſes &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affaires that did lye upon the hands of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, David, Daniel, Elias, Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> 
               <hi>Peter, Cornelius!</hi> and yet you find all theſe worthies exerciſing themſelves in Private prayers. And the King is commanded every day to read ſome part of Gods word,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40722:123"/> notwithſtanding all his great and weighty imployments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20. Now certainly, Sirs, your great buſineſſes are little more than ciphers, compared with theirs: And if there were any on earth that might have pleaded an exemption from private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, upon the account of buſineſs, of much buſineſs, of great buſineſs, theſe might have done it; but they were more honeſt, and more noble than to neglect ſo choice a duty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of much buſineſs; theſe brave hearts made all their publick imployments ſtoop to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer; they would never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their publick imployments to tread private prayer under foot. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, no mens outward affaires did ever more proſper, than theirs did, who devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to private prayer, notwithſtanding their many and great worldly employments. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the proſperity &amp; outward flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtates of <hi>Moſes, Abraham,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40722:124"/> 
               <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Nehemiah, David, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius;</hi> theſe were much with God in their Cloſets, and God bleſt their bleſſings to them: how <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 17</note> did their cups over flow! what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall favours did God heape upon them, and theirs! No families have been ſo proſpered, protected, and graced, as theirs who have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſecret communion with God in a Corner. Private prayer <note place="margin">1 Chron. 11. 9.</note> doth beſt expedite our temporal affairs; he that prayes well in his Cloſet, ſhall be ſure to ſpeed well in his Shop, or at his Plough, or <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> what-ever elſe he turns his hand unto. 'Tis true, <hi>Abimelech</hi> was rich as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſo was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> rich as well as <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> was a King as well as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> was an Emperour as well as <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> But 'twas only <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, David,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who had their bleſſings bleſt unto them all the reſt had their bleſſings curſt unto them; they had many <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 33.

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:40722:124"/> with what they had: and therefore all their mercies were but bitter-ſweets unto them. Though all the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> returned laden from <note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Aegypt</hi> with corn and money in their ſacks, yet <hi>Benjamin</hi> only had the ſilver cup in the mouth of his ſack. So, though the men of the world have their Corn, and their Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet 'tis only God's <hi>Benjamin's</hi> that have the ſilver Cup, the Grace-Cup, the <hi>Cup of bleſſing,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16</note> it, for their portion. O ſirs, as ever you would proſper, and flouriſh in the world; as ever you would have your water turn'd into wine, your temporal mercies into ſpiritual benefits, be much with God in your cloſets But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, 'Tis ten to one but that the objecter, every day fools away, or trifles away, or idles away, or ſins away, one hour in a day; and why then ſhould he object the want of time? There are none that toyle, and moyle, and buſie themſelves moſt in their

            <p>There were three ſpecial faults whereof <hi>Cato</hi> profeſſed himſelf to have ſeriouſly repented; one was paſſing by water when he might have gone by land, another was truſting a ſecret in a womans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but the main was ſpending an hour unprofirably. This heathen will one day riſe up in Judgment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40722:125"/> againſt them, who notwithſtanding their great imployments, ſpend many hours in a week unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and yet cry out with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> that they have ſo much to do on earth, that they have no time to look up to heaven. 'Twas a baſe and ſordid ſpirit in that King <hi>(Sardanapalus)</hi> who ſpent much of his time amongſt women in ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and carding, which ſhould have been ſpent in Ruling and governing his Kingdome. So 'tis a baſe ſordid ſpirit in any, to ſpend any of their time in toying and trifling, and then to cry out, that they have ſo much buſineſs to do in the World, that they have no time for cloſet-prayer, they have no time to ſerve God, nor to ſave their own precious and immortal ſouls. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, No man dares plead this objection before the Lord Jeſus in the great day of account: And why then ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be ſo childiſh &amp; fooliſh, ſo <note place="margin">

O Sirs, we ſhould redeem time for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, out of our eating time, our drinking time, our ſleeping time, our buying time, our ſelling time, our ſinning time, our ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, rather than neglect our Cloſet communion with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, Cloſet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is either a duty, or 'tis no duty. Now that 'tis a duty, I have ſo ſtrongly proved, I ſuppoſe, that no man nor devil, can fairly or honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny it to be a duty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why do men cry out of their great buſineſs? alaſs duty muſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40722:130"/> be done, what ever buſineſs is left undone; duty muſt muſt be done, or the man that neglects it, will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. 'Tis a vaine thing to object buſineſs, when a required du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be performed; and indeed, if the bare objecting of buſineſs, of much buſineſs, were enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe men from duty, I am afraid that there are but few duties of the Goſpel, but men would endeavour to evade, under a pretence of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of much buſineſs. He that pretends buſineſs to evade private prayer, will be as ready to pretend buſineſs to evade family prayer; and he that pretends buſineſs to evade family prayer, will be as ready to pretend buſineſs to evade publick prayer. Well ſirs, remember what became of thoſe that excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of heaven, by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Apologies, &amp; ſecular buſineſſes. <hi>I have bought a peice of ground, and I</hi>

The things of the world and their carnal relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had taken up ſo much room in their hearts and affections, that they had no ſtomack to heavens danties; and therefore it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, what Chriſt adds at the end of the parable, <hi>He that hateth not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
               <hi>yea, and his own Life alſo,</hi> much more his Farm and his Oxen, <hi>he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> By theſe words 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that 'twas not ſimply the Farm nor the Oxen, nor the Wife; but a fooliſh, inordinate, carnal love, and eſteeme of theſe things above better and greater bleſſings, that made them refuſe the gracious invitation of Chriſt. They refuſed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40722:131"/> the grace and mercy of God offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, under a pretence of their worldly buſineſs; and God peremptorily concludes, that not a man of them ſhould taſt of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And indeed what can be more juſt and righteous, than that they ſhould never ſo much as taſt of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual &amp; eternal bleſſings, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their earthly buſineſs before heavens dainties; who with the <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites</hi> prefer a countrey commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <note place="margin">Num. 23.</note> for the feeding of their Cattle, before an intereſt in the Land of Promiſe Private prayer is a work of abſolute neceſſity, both to the bringing of the heart into a good frame, and to the keeping of the heart in a good frame. 'Tis of abſolute neceſſity both for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſin, and for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſin, and for the imbittering of ſin, and for the weakning of ſin, and for the purging away of ſin: 'Tis of abſolute neceſſity, both for the diſcovery of grace, and for a full exerciſe of grace, and for an eminent increaſe of grace:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40722:132"/>
'Tis of abſolute neceſſity to arme us, both againſt inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations, afflictions, and ſufferings: 'Tis of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to fit us for all other duties and ſervices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For a man to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, to ſave his own ſoul, and to further his own everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is a work of the greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: Now private prayer is ſuch a work; and therefore why ſhould any man plead buſineſs, great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when a work of ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity is before him. If a mans child, or wife, were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick, or wounded, or near to death, he would never plead, <hi>I have buſineſs, I have a great deale of buſineſs to doe; and therefore I cannot ſtay with my child, my wife; and I have no time to goe or ſend to the Phyſitian,</hi> &amp;c. O! no, but he would rather argue thus, <hi>'Tis abſolutely neceſſary that I ſhould looke after the preſervation of the life of my child, my wife, and this I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend whatever becomes of my buſineſs.</hi> O ſirs, your ſouls are of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to you, than the lives of

            <p>Seventhly, I anſwer, That God did never appoint or deſigne any mans ordinary, particular calling, to thruſt private prayer out of door.

And all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, before they were called to the work of the Miniſtry, had their particular callings.</p>

And 'tis by all Writers condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a very great vanity in <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> that would needs be the beſt Poet.

But for a man to evade or neglect private prayer under pretence of his particular calling, is a greeable to no Scripture, yea, 'tis contrary to very many Scriptures, as is evident by the many Arguments formerly cited. Certainly, no mans calling
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40722:134"/> is a calling away from God, or godlineſs. It never entered into the heart of God, that our particular callings ſhould ever drive out of doores our general calling of Chriſtianity. Look as our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral calling muſt not eat up our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, ſo our particular calling muſt not eat up our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral calling. Certainly, our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling muſt give place to our general calling. Did not the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> leave her water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, and run into the city, and <note place="margin">John. 4. 28, 29.</note> ſay, <hi>come ſee a man that told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Chriſt?</hi> Did not the ſhepherds leave their flocks in the field and goe to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and declare the good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of great joy, that they had <note place="margin">Luke 2. 8,—21.</note> heard of the Angel, <hi>viz.

               </note> for that holy neglect of her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, when ſhe ſat at his ſeet, and heard his word? And what do all theſe inſtances ſhew,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40722:134"/> but that our particular callings muſt give the right hand to the general calling of chriſtianity. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the works of our general calling are far more great and glorious, more eminent and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, more high and noble, than the works of our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are; and therefore 'tis much more to lerable for our general cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to borrow time of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, than 'tis for our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling to borrow time of our general calling. Certainly thoſe men are very ignorant or very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, that either think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo cloſely tied up to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their particular callings ſix dayes in the week, as that they muſt not intermeddle with any religious ſervices, or that think their particular callings to be a gulf or a grave deſigned by God to ſwallow up private prayer in.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40722:135"/> dayes of the week, yet they were <note place="margin">Exod. 29. 38, 39. Num. 28. 3.</note> commanded alſo to offer up morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening ſacrifice daily.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> divided the day into three parts;</p>
            <p>The firſt, to Prayer.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, for the reading of the Law.</p>
            <p>And the third for the works of their lawful callings.</p>
            <p>As bad as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, yet they every day ſet a part of the day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for religious exerciſes. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they are worſe than <hi>Jews</hi> that ſpend all their time about their particular callings, and ſhut cloſet prayer quite out of doors. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that mans ſoul is in a very ill caſe, who is ſo entangled with the incumbrances of the world, that he can ſpare no time for private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If God be the Lord of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Lord of thy time, and the Lord of thy ſoul, how can'ſt thou with any equity or honour, put off his ſervice under a pretence of much buſineſs? that man is loſt, that man is curſt, who can find time
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40722:135"/> for any thing, but none to meet with God in his Cloſet. That man is doubtleſs upon the brink of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, whoſe worldly buſineſs eats up all thoughts of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, of Eternity, of his Soul, and of his ſoul concernments. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly &amp; laſtly, I anſwer, The more worldly buſineſs lyes upon thy hand, the more need haſt thou to keep cloſe to thy cloſet. Much buſineſs layes a man open to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, and to many ſnares, and to many temptations. Now the more ſins, ſnares and temptations a mans buſineſs lays him open to, the more need that man hath to be much in private prayer, that his ſoul may be kept pure from ſin, and that his foot may not be taken in the Devils trap, and that he may ſtand faſt in the hour of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Private prayer is ſo far from <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 2, 3. Pſal. 127. 1, 2. Pſal. 128. 1. 2.</note> being a hinderance to a mans buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that 'tis the way of wayes to bring down a bleſſing from heaven upon a mans buſineſs; as the firſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40722:136"/> fruits that Gods people gave to him brought down a bleſſing from heaven upon all the reſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 10, 11. Whet is no let; Prayer and Provender never hinders a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Private prayer is like to <hi>Jacob</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 27, 30.</note> that brought down a bleſſing from heaven upon all that <hi>Laban</hi> had. Private prayer gives a man a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe, both of all his earthly comforts, and of all his earthly buſineſs; and this <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> found by experience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas not their great publick imployments that could take them off from their private duties. Time ſpent in heavenly imployments, is <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 1, to 8.</note> no time loſt from worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Private prayer makes all we take in hand ſucceſsful. Cloſet pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath made many rich, but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any man poor or beggarly in this world. No man on earth knows what may be the emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or the occurrences of a day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> Every day is as it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40722:136"/> it were a great-belly'd day. Every day is as it were with child of ſomething, but what it will bring forth, whether a croſs or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, no man can tell; as whilſt a woman is with child, no man can tell what kind of birth it will be. No man knows what mercies a day may bring forth, no man knowes what miſeries a day may bring forth; no man knows what good a day may bring forth, no man knows what evil a day may bring forth; no man knowes what afflictions a day may bring forth, no man knows what temptations a day may bring forth; no man knows what liberty a day may bring forth, no man knows what bonds a day may bring forth; no man knows what good ſucceſs a day may bring forth, no man knows what bad ſucceſs a day may bring forth; and therefore a man had need be every day in his cloſet with God, that he may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted to entertain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all the occurrences, ſucceſſes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40722:137"/> and emergencies, that may attend him in the courſe of his life. And let thus much ſuffice for anſwer to this firſt Objection. But,</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, others may Obiect and ſay,</hi> Sir, we grant that Private Prayer is an indiſpenſible duty that lies upon the people of God; but we are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and we have no time that we can call our own, and our maſters buſineſs is ſuch as will not allow us any time for private prayer, and therefore we hope we may be excuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Sol. 1.</label>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the Text is indefinite, and not limited to any ſort or rank of <note place="margin">Private prayer is a duty that lieth upon Saints as Saints.</note> perſons, whether high or low, rich or poor, bond or free, ſervant or maſter. <hi>But thou when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet; and when thou haſt ſhut the door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret.</hi> Here are three thou's, <hi>thou, thou, thou,</hi> which are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40722:137"/> to be underſtood indefinitely; thou ſervant as well as thou maſter, thou bond-man as well as thou free-man, thou poor man as well as thou rich man, thou maid as well as thou miſtreſs, thou child as well as thou father, thou wife as well as thou husband. Private prayer is an indiſpenſible duty that lies upon all ſorts and ranks of perſons. A man may as well ſay that that Pronoun <hi>(Tu) thou</hi> that runs through the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>(Thou ſhalt have no other</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 3,—18.</note> 
               <hi>gods before me. Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven image. Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them nor ſerve them. Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Six dayes ſhalt thou labour. Thou ſhalt not kill. Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. Thou ſhalt not ſteal. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour. Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours houſe, thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his man ſervant, nor his maid ſervant, nor his oxe, nor his aſs, nor any thing that is thy neighbours,</hi> &amp;c.) relates to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40722:138"/> the rich, and not to the poor, to maſters and not to ſervants, to the free, and not to them that are in bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he may ſay, that the three <hi>thou's</hi> in the Text relates to the rich and not to the poor, to maſters and not to ſervants, to thoſe that are free, but not to thoſe that are bound; but certainly there is no man in his wits that will ſay ſo, that will affirm ſuch a thing. Doubtleſs this Pronoune <hi>Thou,</hi> reacheth every man, of what rank or quality ſoever he be in this world. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the firſt the third, the fourth, the fifth, the ſixth, the ſeventh, and the eighth Anſwers that are given to the firſt Objection, are here very applicable; and O that all maſters and ſervants were ſo wiſe, ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo ingenious, as to lay all thoſe anſwers warm on their own hearts: It might be a means to prevent much ſin. and to beſpeak maſters and miſtreſſes to give their pious ſervants a little more time to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40722:138"/> lift up their hearts to Chriſt in a corner. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, If thou art a ſervant that haſt liberty to chooſe a new Maſter, thou wert better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 10 Pſal. 120. 5.</note> thy ſtation than live under ſuch a maſters roof, who is ſuch an enemy to God, to Chriſt, to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to himſelf, and to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare of thy poor ſoul, as that he will not give thee half an hours time in a day to ſpend in thy chamber, thy cloſet, though the glory of God, the good of his own family, and the everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thine own ſoul, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. 'Tis better for thee to ſhift thy maſter, than to neglect thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Art thou called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant? care not for it; but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Juſtinus</hi> the ſecond Fmperours Motto was <hi>Libertas res ineſtimabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</note> We loſt our liberty by ſin, and we affect nothing more than liberty by nature.</p>
            <p>The Rabins ſay of Liberty, <hi>That if the Heavens were Parchment, the Sea Inke, and every pile of Graſs a Pen, the praiſes of it could not be comprized nor</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:40722:139"/> 
               <hi>expreſſed. Labans</hi> houſe was full of Idols; great houſes are often ſo. <hi>Jacobs</hi> tent was little, but the true worſhip of God was in it. 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better to live in <hi>Jacobs</hi> tent, than in <hi>Labans</hi> houſe. 'Tis beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch Maſters where we may have leaſt of ſin, and moſt of God; where we may have the moſt helps, the beſt examples, and the choiſeſt encouragements to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happy.</p>
            <p>The religious ſervant ſhould be as careful in the choice of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as the religious maſter is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the choice of his ſervant. Gracious ſervants are great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to the families where they live; and that maſter may well be called the unhappy maſter, who will rather part with a gracious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, than ſpare him a little time in a day, to pour out his ſoul before the Lord in a corner. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, If thou art a gracious ſervant, then thou art ſpirited and principled by God, to that very purpoſe, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40722:139"/> cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> when thou art <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. Gal. 4. 6. 1 Cor. 6. 19. 2 Tim. 1. 14.</note> alone, when thou art in a corner, and no eye ſeeth thee, but his who ſeeth in ſecret. If thou are a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant, then thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. Now he that hath this tree of life, he hath alſo the fruit that grows upon this tree, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. <hi>But the fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> &amp;c. Now grace is called, not the works of the Spirit, but the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe all grace is derived from the Spirit, as the fruit is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the root. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To note the pleaſantneſs and delightfulneſs of grace: for what is more pleaſant and delightful, than <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16. Chap. 6. 2.</note> ſweet and wholeſome fruits?</p>
            <p n="3">3. To note the profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that doth redown to them that have the Spirit: for as many grow rich by the fruits of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and orchards; ſo many grow
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40722:140"/> rich in grace, in holineſs, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in ſpiritual experiences, by the fruits of the Spirit. Now why hath God given thee his Spirit, and why hath he laid into thy ſoul a ſtock of ſupernatural graces, but that thou mayeſt be every way qualified, diſpoſed, and fitted for private prayer, and to maintain ſecret communion with God in a corner.</p>
            <p>Certainly, God never gave any poor ſervant, a talent of gifts, or a talent of grace, but in order to his driving of a ſecret trade heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I anſwer, Though King <hi>Darius</hi> had made a degree, that none ſhould ask any Petition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, God or man, for thirty dayes upon the Penalty of being caſt into the Den of Lyons, yet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was both a ſubject and a ſervant to King <hi>Darius,</hi> and one upon whoſe <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> hands the chiefeſt and greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Kingdom did lye, did keep up his private Devotions. In the firſt &amp; ſecond verſes of that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40722:140"/> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> you will find that <hi>Daniel</hi> had abundance of great and weighty imployments upon his hands; he was ſet over the whole affairs of the whole Empire of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> and he with two other Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (of whom himſelf was chief) were to receive the accounts of the whole Kingdome, from all thoſe hundred and twenty Princes, which in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy were imployed in all publick buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And yet, notwithſtanding ſuch a multiplicity of buſineſs as lay upon his hands, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſervile condition, yet he was very careful to redeem time for private prayer; yea, 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the heart of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the mid'ſt of all his mighty buſineſſes, was ſo much ſet upon private prayer, upon his ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements for Religious exerciſes, that he runs the hazard of loſing all his honours, profits, pleaſures, yea, and life it ſelf, rather than he would be deprived of convenient time &amp; opportunities to wait upon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40722:141"/> God in his chamber. Certainly, <hi>Daniel</hi> will one day riſe in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt all thoſe ſubjects and ſervants who think to evade private prayer, by their plea's of much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and of their being ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, If you who are gracious ſervants, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your Maſters buſineſſes, cannot redeem a little time to wreſtle with God in a corner, what ſingular thing doe you? what doe you more than others? Doe you hear? So do others. Do you read? ſo doe others. Do you follow your Maſters to publick prayers? So do others. Doe you joyn with your Maſters in family prayers? ſo do others. O but now gracious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould goe beyond all other ſervants in the world, they ſhould do ſingular things for God, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 47. <hi>What doe you more then others?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? What extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing doe you? what more ordinary than to find ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s follow their Maſters to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40722:141"/> Prayers, and to Family Prayers? O but now to finde poor ſervants to redeem a little time from their Maſters buſineſs, to pour out their ſouls before the Lord in a corner, this is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; yea, this is extraordinary, and this doth wonderfully well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gracious ſervants. O that all mens ſervants, who are ſervants to the moſt high God, would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider;</p>
            <p>Firſt, How ſingularly they are priviledged by God above all other ſervants in the world. They are <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</note> called, adopted, reconciled, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, juſtified before the throne of God, which other ſervants are not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why then ſhould not ſuch ſervants be ſingular in their ſervices, who are ſo ſingular in their priviledges?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gracious ſervants are made partakers of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature than other ſervants are. 2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; that by theſe you might be made</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40722:142"/> 
               <hi>partakers of the divine nature.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">None but Familiſts will ſay, that we are made partakers of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any creature. The Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beings.</note> in this expreſſion doth not aime at any eſſential change and converſion of our ſubſtance into the nature of God, and Chriſt; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the elevation, and dignifying of our nature by Chriſt. Though that reall, that neer, that dear, that choice, that myſterious, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, that ſingular union that Chriſtians have with Chriſt, doth raiſe them up to a higher ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and likeneſs of God and Chriſt, than ever they had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in their primitive perfection; yet it doth not introduce any real tranſmutation, either of our bodies or ſouls, into the divine nature. 'Tis certain, that our union and conjunction with Chriſt, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mingle perſons, nor unite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but it doth conjoyne our affections, and brings our wills into a League of Amity with Chriſt. To be made partaker of of the divine nature, notes two things, ſay ſome,</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:40722:142"/>
            <p> Firſt, A fellowſhip with God in his holineſs;</p>
            <p>Secondly, A fellowſhip with God in his bleſſedneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> In the beatifical viſion, and brightneſs of glory. To be made partakers of the divine nature, ſay others, is to be made partakers of thoſe holy graces, thoſe divine qualities, which ſometimes are called, <hi>The Image of God, the likeneſs of God, the life of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby we reſemble God not only as a picture doth a man in outward lineaments, but as a child doth his father in countenance and conditions. Now take the words which way you will; how highly doth it concern thoſe ſervants, that are made partakers of the divine nature, to doe ſingular things for God, to doe ſuch things for God, that other ſervants that are not partakers of the divine nature, have no mind, no heart, no ſpirit to do; yea, that they refuſe and ſcorn to do?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gracious ſervants are worthily deſcended, they have the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40722:143"/> moſt illuſtrious extraction, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable original, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. <hi>James.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gracious ſervants are worthily attended, they are nobly guarded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Deu.</hi> 33. 26, 27. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Gracious ſervants are worthily dignified; they are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with the higheſt and moſt honourable Titles, <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 2, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5, 10.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Take many things in one. Gracious ſervants have more excellent graces, experiences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, communions, promiſes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, diſcoveries, hopes, helps, principles, diet, rayment, porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than all other ſervants in the world have; and therefore God may well expect better and greater things from them, than from all other ſervants in the world. God may very well expect that they ſhould doe ſingular things for his Glory, who hath done ſuch ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things for their good. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God expects that gracious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40722:143"/> ſhould be a bleſſing of him, when other ſervants are a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of him; that they ſhould be a magnifying of him, when other ſervants are a debaſing of him; that they ſhould be a redeeming of precious time, when other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are a trifling, fooling, playing or ſinning away of procious time; that they ſhould be a weeping in a corner, when other ſervants are a ſporting and making themſelves merry among their jovall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; that they ſhould be a mourning in ſecret, when other ſervants are a ſinning in ſecret; and that they ſhould be at their private devotion, when other ſervants are ſleeping and ſnorting, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I have read of <hi>Ingo,</hi> an ancient King of the <hi>Draves</hi> and <hi>Veneds,</hi> who making a ſtately feaſt, appointed all his <hi>Pagan</hi> Nobles to ſit in the Hall below; and at the ſame time commanded certain poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be brought up into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40722:144"/> Chamber to fit with him at <note place="margin">

               </note> his Table, that they might eat of his kingly chear; at which many wondering, he told them, That he accounted Chriſtians, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo poor, a greater ornament at his Table, and more worthy of his company, than the greateſt Nobles that were not converted to the Chriſtian faith; for ſaith he, when theſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Nobles ſhall be thruſt down to Hell, theſe poor Chriſtians ſhall be my conſorts and fellow Princes in Heaven. Certainly, this noble Prince will one day riſe in Judgement againſt all ſowre, churliſh <hi>Labans,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſo harſhly, and ſo ſeverely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their gracious ſervants, as <note place="margin">Epheſ. 69.</note> that they will not allow them a little time, to wait upon God in a hole. Why ſhould not gracious maſters give their gracious ſervants a little time for cloſet prayer now, conſidering that they are ſharers with them in all the fundamental good that comes by Chriſt in this world; and conſidering, that they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40722:145"/> ſhall be partakers with them in all the glory of another world. The <note place="margin">Every man hath two things to look unto more than all the world be ſide; a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a ſoul: for the one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is either a Fool or a Phyſitian; for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either a Devil or a Divine, ſaith one.</note> pooreſt ſervant in a family hath a ſoul more precious than heaven and earth; and the greateſt work that lies upon his hand in this world is to look to the eternal ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; ſecurity of that, for if that be ſafe all is ſafe, if that be well all is well, but if that be loſt all is loſt. Every gracious ſervant, though he be never ſo poor and mean, yet hath he the image of God, the image of the King of Kings ſtampt upon him; and wo to him that ſhall wrong, or deſpiſe, or trample upon that image. Certainly, God himſelf is wronged by the injury that is done to his image. The contempt and deſpite that is done to the image or coyn of a King, is done to the King himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he will revenge it.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40722:145"/> it be in thoſe maſters, who deſpiſe, revile, reproach, ſcorn, abuſe and tread under foot, ſuch ſervants as have the image of the great God ſtampt upon their ſouls, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look God-ward, Chriſt-ward, Heaven-ward, Holineſs-ward, Duty-ward! Maſters ſhould never twit their ſervants in the <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 2. Chap. 17. 5.</note> teeth with their inferiority, penury, poverty, miſery, mean parentage, or ſervile condition; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that theſe things are more the Creators pleaſure, than the ſervants fault, and that that God that hath made the maſter rich and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant poor, can as quickly make the maſter poor and the ſervant rich. God many times puts down <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 52.</note> the mighty from their ſeats, and exalts them of low degree. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no maſter nor miſtreſs ſhould dare to inſult or triumph over ſuch ſervants as have ſouls as noble as their own; but they ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and frequently conſider of <hi>Solomons</hi> Aphoriſme, <hi>The righteous</hi> (though a ſervant, though the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40722:146"/> meaneſt amongſt all the ſervants) <hi>is more excellent than his neighbour,</hi> and accordingly give them a little time and liberty to converſe with God in ſecret. And O that all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſervants would diſcover themſelves to be more excellent than their neighbours, by making more conſcience of private prayer than their neighbours do, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in their cloſets than their neighbours are, and by delighting themſelves in their ſecret retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more than their neighbours will, and by redeeming ſome time for God, for their ſouls, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity more than their neighbours do. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I anſwer, That God is only the Lord of time. Time is <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 3. Dan. 11. 27. 29. 35. Job 7. 1. Pſal. 102. 13 Eccl. 3. 1. Dan. 2. 21 Iſa. 60. 22.

Not only the times of his ſorrows, but alſo the times of his comforts; not only the times of his miſeries, but alſo the times of his mercies; not only the times of his dangers, but alſo the times of his duties, were in the hands of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, the Pſalmiſt doth not ſay time, but times, in the plural, to ſhew that every point and period of time, depends upon the hand of God.</p>
            <p>One complaining of thoſe who ſay, <hi>Come, let us talk together to paſs away the time;</hi> with grief of ſpirit <note place="margin">Bernard, Serm. de tripl. cuſtod.</note> cryes out <hi>(O donec praetereat hora,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>O until the hour be gone, O until time be paſt, which the mercy of thy maker hath beſtowed upon thee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme repentance, to procure pardon, to gain grace, and to obtain glory.</hi> That ſervant that borrows a little time every day to ſeek the face of God in a corner, borrows it rather of God than of his maſter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould his maſter ſwell, or rage, or complain, conſidering
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40722:147"/> that God never made him Lord of time. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, I anſwer, That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould rather redeem time from their ſleep, their recreations, their daily meals, than neglect clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet duty a day. And certainly thoſe ſervants that (out of conſcience towards God, and out of a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the internal and eternal welfare of their own ſouls) ſhall every day redeem an hours time from their ſleep, or ſports, or feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to ſpend with God in ſecret, they ſhall find by experience, that the Lord will make a few hours ſleep, ſweeter and better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours ſleep to them, and their outward ſports ſhall be made up with inward delights, and for their common bread, God will feed them with that bread that came down from heaven. Sirs, was not Chriſt <note place="margin">The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies theſe words to Chriſt, Mat. 12. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> his Fathers ſervant? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The redeeming of time for private prayer, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of a precious treaſure,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40722:148"/> which if once loſt can never fully be recovered again. If riches ſhould make themſelves wings and fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they may return again, as they did to <hi>Job;</hi> or, if credit, and honour, and worldly greatneſs and renown ſhould fly away, they may return again, as they did to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> If ſucceſs, and famous victories and conqueſts ſhould make themſelves wings and fly away, they may return again, as they did to many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerors and others: But, if <note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> drew the picture of Time with three heads;</p>
            <p>The Firſt was, of a greedy Wolf gaping for time paſt, becauſe it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40722:148"/> hath ravenouſly devoured even the memory of ſo many things paſt recalling.</p>
            <p>The Second, Of a crowned Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on roaring for time preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath the principality of all action, for which it calls aloud.</p>
            <p>And the Third was, of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Dog, fawning for time to come; becauſe it feedes fond men with many flattering hopes to their eternal undoing. O that all this might prevail with ſervants to redeem time for private prayer! And if my counſel might take place, I ſhould rather adviſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to redeem ſome time for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, from their ſleep, or lawful recreations, or ſet meales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to ſpend, in private pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, that time which their maſters call their time; eſpecially if their Maſters be unconverted and in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and that for theſe five Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe this may be a means to prevent much Sin on the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40722:149"/> Maſters ſide. Maſters that are in their unregenerate eſtate, are very apt to ſtorm, and take on, and let fly againſt God, and Chriſt, and Religion, &amp; profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they ſee their ſervants ſpend that time in private prayer, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other religious excerciſe, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their underſtanding, is their time, and ought to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent in following their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Now gracious ſervants ſhould have that honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and that tender affection, and that Chriſtian compaſſion, to their Maſters ſouls, as to do to the utmoſt all that lyes in them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Maſters from contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilt upon their ſouls, or from <note place="margin">Jude. 22, 23.</note> making work for repentance, for hell, or for the Phyſitian of ſouls.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Indians</hi> are ſo compaſſionate that they erect Hoſpitals, not only for lame and diſeaſed Men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for Birds Beaſts, &amp; Dogs, that are either, aged, ſtarved, or hurt. O then, what tender compaſſions ſhould
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40722:149"/> gracious ſervants exerciſe towards their Maſters ſouls, which are Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels more worth then heaven and earth! But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe this may be a means to convince the Judgments and Conſciences of their Maſters, that there is ſome worth, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, ſome ſweetneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be found in private prayer, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloſet duties; for when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhall obſerve their ſervants to redeem time for cloſet duties, from their very ſleep, recreations, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſuppers, they will be ready to conclude, that certainly there is more worth, more goodneſs, more ſweetneſs, more excellency, more glory, more gain, in cloſet duties, than ever they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, felt, or experienced, &amp;c. and that there very poor ſervants are better and more righteous than themſelves. <hi>Sotomen</hi> reports, that the devout life of a poore Captive Chriſtian woman, made a King &amp; all his Family imbrace the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Good works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40722:150"/> more than Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>I have read of one <hi>Pachomius,</hi> a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor, how that his Army being almoſt ſtarved for want of neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, he came to a city of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and they of their own chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty relieved them ſpeedily and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he wondering at their free and noble charity, enquired what kind of people they were, whom he ſaw ſo bountiful? it was anſwered, that they were Chriſtians, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it is to hurt no man, and do good to every man: hereupon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius,</hi> convinced of the excellency of this Religion, threw away his Arms, and became a Chriſtian, a Saint. Look as Husbands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1, 2.</note> are won by the converſation of their wives without the word ſo Maſters may ſometimes be won by the gracious carriage and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their ſervants, without the word. The ſervants redeeming of time for private duties upon the hardeſt and ſevereſt tearms, may
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40722:150"/> be ſo bleſt to the Maſter, that it may iſſue in his conviction, converſion, and ſalvation. There is a <hi>may-be</hi> for it; and a very <hi>may-be</hi> ſhould be a ſufficient encouragement for every gracious ſervant, to do all he can to ſave the ſoul of his Maſter, from going down into the infernal Pit. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the ſervants redeeming of time from his ſleep, recreations, meals, for private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will moſt clearly and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence the ſingular love, the great delight, and the high eſteem that he hath of private prayer. We ſay thoſe children love their books well, and delight much in learning, who will be at their books when others are gone to their beds, and who will be at their books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others can get out of their beds. Certainly, they love pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer well, and they delight much in cloſet communion with God, who will be a praying when others are a ſleeping, and who will be addreſſing their ſouls before God
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40722:151"/> in a corner, before their miſtreſs is a dreſſing of her ſelf at the Glaſs, or their fellow-ſervants a dreſſing themſelves in the ſhop. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the ſervants redeeming of time for private prayer, from his ſleep, ſet meales, recreations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be of moſt uſe to other fellow ſervants, both to awaken them, and to convince them that the things of Religion are of the greateſt and higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that there is no trade for pleaſure, or profit, to that private Trade that is driven between God and a mans own ſoul; and alſo, to keep them from trifling, or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of that time, which is truly and properly their Maſters time, and by the Royal law of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ought to be ſpent ſolely and wholly in their ſervice &amp; buſineſs. For what ingenious ſervant is there in the world, but will argue thus? I ſee that ſuch and ſuch of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants will redeem time for private prayer, and for other cloſet ſervices, from their very ſleep,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40722:151"/> meales recreations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rather than they will borrow, or make bold with that time which my Maſter ſaith is his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why then ſhould I be ſo fooliſh, ſo bruitiſh, ſo mad, to trifle, or idle, or play, or toy away that time, wnich ſhould be ſpent in my maſters ſervice, and for my maſters advantage? But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, Becauſe the ſervants redeeming of time for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer from his Sleep, his Meales, his Recreations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot but be infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and that which will afford him moſt comfort when he comes to die. The more any poor heart acts contrary to fleſh and blood, the more he pleaſes God; the more any poor heart denyes himſelf, the more he pleaſes God; the more any poor heart acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtreame of ſinful exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the more he pleaſes God; the more difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a poor heart meets with in the diſcharg of his duty, the more love he ſhewes to God; and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40722:152"/> more love a poor heart ſhewes to God, the more he pleaſes God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Go, and cry in the ears of Jeruſalem, ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals; when thou wenteſt after me in the wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown. Iſrael was holineſs unto the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe: all that devour him, ſhall offend; evil ſhall come upon them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> God was very highly pleaſed, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted with the ſingular love and choice affections of his people towards him, when they followed after him and kept cloſe to him, in that tedious and uncouth paſſage through the waſte, howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How all theſe things do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with that poor pious ſervant that redeemes time for private prayer upon the hardeſt termes imaginable, I ſhall leave the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Reader to judge. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, upon a dying bed, no tongue can expreſs, nor heart conceive (but he that feeles it) the unſpeakable
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40722:152"/> comfort that cloſet duties will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to him that hath been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in them, upon thoſe hard termes that are under preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. But,</p>
            <p>Ninthly, I anſwer, If thou art a gracious ſervant, then the near and dear relations that is between God and thee, and the choice priviledges <note place="margin">John 8. 32, 33, 36.</note> that thou art intereſted in, calls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for private prayer. As thou art thy Maſters ſervant, ſo thou art the Lords free-man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>For he that is called in the Lord, being a ſervant, is the Lords free-man: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo, he that is called being free, is Chriſts ſervant. Ye are bought with a price: be not ye the ſervants of men,</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they command you things forbidden by Chriſt, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you things commanded by Chriſt; or when they would exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a dominion over your faith, or a lord-ſhip over your conſciences. Suffer not your ſelves in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things to be brought into ſuch bondage by any men or Maſters in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40722:153"/> the world, as not to uſe that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. Col. 2. 20. Gal. 2. 4.</note> and liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſed for you with his deareſt blood. No ſervants are to ſerve their maſters in oppoſition to Chriſt; nor no ſervants are to ſerve their maſters as ſpiritual maſters; Nor no ſervants are to ſerve their maſters as ſupream maſters, but as ſubordinate maſters, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. And as every gracious ſervant is the Lords free-man, ſo every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſervant is the Lords friend, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. 23. <hi>John</hi> 15. 13, 14, 15. And as every graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant is the Lords friend, ſo every gracious ſervant is the Lords ſon, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. And as every gracious ſervant is the Lords ſon, ſo every gracious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is the Lords ſpouſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
            <p>And now I appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all that have taſted that the Lord is gracious, whether the near and dear relations that is between the Lord and pious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, doth not call aloud upon
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40722:153"/> them to take all opportunities and advantages that poſſibly they can to pour out their ſouls before the Lord in ſecret, and to acquaint him in a corner with all their ſecret wants, &amp; weakneſſes, &amp; wiſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as gracious ſervants are thus nearly and dearly related to God, ſo gracious ſervants are very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priviledged by God. Gracious ſervants are as much freed from the reign of ſin, the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, and the damnato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> power of ſin, as gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are. Gracious ſervants are as <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> much freed from hell, from the curſe of the Law, and from the wrath of God, as their gracious maſters are. Gracious ſervants are <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> as much adopted, as much recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, as much pardoned, as much juſtified, and as much redeemed, as their gracious maſters are. Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervants are as much heirs, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 10. Col. 3. 11. Gal. 5. 6. Rom. 8. 17. Gal. 6. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt, as their gracious maſters are. Gracious ſervants are as much a choſen generation, a royal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40722:154"/> an holy nation, a peculiar people, called out of darkneſs into his marvelous light, as their graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious maſters are. And therefore they being all alike intereſted in all theſe great and glorious priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which belong to Saints as Saints, they are without all peradventure alike obliged and engaged to all thoſe duties which lies upon Saints as Saints, among which private prayer is one; and therefore they are to buckle to this duty, againſt all carnal reaſons and objections whatſoever. But,</p>
            <p>Tenthly and laſtly, I anſwer, That the promiſed reward in the Text, lies as fair and as open to the Servant as to the Maſter, to the Bond as to the Free, to the Peaſant as to the Prince. Whoſoever prays to his heavenly father in ſecret, be he high or low, rich or poor, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or baſe, ſervant or maſter, he ſhall receive an open reward. The reward in the text is not to be confined or limited to this or that ſort or rank of men, but 'tis to be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40722:154"/> extended to all ranks and ſorts of men, that make conſcience of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, of cloſet duties. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Servants be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them that are your maſters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in ſingleneſs of your heart, as unto Chriſt. Not with eye-ſervice, as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Kings did uſually reward the faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Surely the King of Kings will not fall ſhort of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>with good will doing ſervice, as to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be bond or free.</hi> Col. 3. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Servants obey, in all things, your maſters according to the fleſh, not with eye ſervice, as men-pleaeſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart, fearing God. And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men: Knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the inheritance: for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Such ſervants as ſerve their maſters faithfully, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, and in ſingleneſs of ſpirit, ſhall receive the reward of Grace, &amp; the reward of the Inheritance. The
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40722:155"/> meaneſt ſervant that is faithful in the ſervice of his maſter, ſhall <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. 16, 17.</note> for a recompence recieve the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance. The recompence of reward in the Scripture laſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is not of merit but of meer grace, becauſe the inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to children upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their birth or adoption. Faithful ſervants, ſhall of ſervants be made ſons, and ſo enjoy the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance. Chriſt is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Maſter, that he will not ſuffer any ſervice that hath been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to men out of Conſcience to his command to paſs unrewarded. O how much more will he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence pious ſervants for thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſervices that they perform for his ſake, for his glory! God is ſo liberal a pay maſter, that no <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 10.</note> man ſhall ſo much as ſhut the door, or kindle a fire upon his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or give a cup of cold water, <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 42.</note> one of the leaſt, readieſt, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt refreſhments that be, but he ſhall be rewarded.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40722:155"/>
            <p> It is an excellent obſervation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon Gods rewarding of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 19. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>often recompenceth the ſhadows and ſeeming appearances of vertue, to ſhew that complacency he takes in the ample rewards that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for true and ſincere piety. Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> though a Tyrant, yet being engaged in Gods ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Ezek. 29. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Tyre,</hi> he ſhall have <hi>Egypt</hi> as his pay, for his pains at <hi>Tyre.</hi> It is an ancient ſlur and ſlander that hath been caſt upon God, as if he were an auſtere Maſter, an illiberal Lord, and as if there were nothing to be got in his ſervice, but knocks, blows, wounds, croſſes, loſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas he is a rewarder, not only of them that diligently ſeek him, <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> but even of the very worſt of men that do any ſervice for him. I have read of <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> (the ſame that was ſmitten by the Angel and eaten up of worms, becauſe he gave not glory to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 23.) that being bound in chains, and ſent to Priſon by <hi>Tiberius</hi> for wiſhing <hi>Caius</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:40722:156"/> in the Empire, one <hi>Thaumaſtus</hi> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <note place="margin">

Now how much more then will the King of Kings reward all thoſe poor pious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his, that do not only give to him in his Members cups of cold water, but do alſo redeem time from their very reſt, meals, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, that they may have ſome time to ſeek the face of God in a corner. Certainly, There ſhall not be a ſigh, a groan, a prayer, a tear let fall by a poor ſervant in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40722:156"/> that ſhall not be at laſt regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rewarded by the great God. <hi>Lyra</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> waited ſix years, before his good ſervice was rewarded by King <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> It may be God may reward thee ſooner for all thy cloſet ſervices; but if he do not reward thee ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he will certainly reward thee better, he will reward thee with higher Honours, with greater Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 29 2 Tim. 4. 8.

And therefore hold on and hold out in your ſecret retirements. Though ſome may deride you, and others revile you, and your carnal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters diſcourage you, yet God is faithful and will certainly reward you; yea, he will openly reward you for all the ſecret pourings out of your ſouls in his boſome.

            <p>Some may further Object and ſay, <hi>O but we cannot pray alone; we want thoſe gifts and endowments which others have; we are ſhut up and know not how to pour out our ſouls before God in a corner; we would willingly pray, but we want ability to pour out our ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in ſecret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Gods deareſt children may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſhut up, they may with <hi>Zacharias,</hi> for a time, be ſtruck <note place="margin">Luke 1. 20.</note> dumb and not able to ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 4. <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak.</hi> Pſal. 38. 9. <hi>Lord; all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is before thee: and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi> Gods deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have ſometimes been ſo ſhut up, that they have been able to ſay nothing, nor to doe nothing but groan. A child of God may ſometimes meet with ſuch a blow from God, from Conſcience, from
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40722:157"/> Scripture, from Satan, from the World, that may for a time ſo aſtoniſh him, that he may not be able to ſpeak to God, nor ſpeak to others, nor ſpeak to his own heart. Look as the holy Spirit is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a teaching Spirit, nor always a leading Spirit, nor always a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Spirit, nor alwayes a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, nor alwayes a witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Spirit, nor alwayes an aſſuring Spirit to any of the Saints; ſo he is not alwayes a ſupplicating Spirit in any of the Saints. When he is grieved, vexed, quenched, provoked, he may ſuſpend his gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and deny the ſoul his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and what can a Chriſtian then ſay or do? But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, Thou canſt not pray; but canſt thou not ſigh, nor groan neither? there may be the ſpirit of Adoption in ſighs and groans, as well as in vocal prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. The force, the vertue, the efficacie, the excellency of prayer doth not conſiſt in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and flouriſh of words, but in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40722:158"/> ſupernatural motions of the ſpirit, in ſighs, and groans, and pangs, and ſtrong affections of heart, that are unſpeakable and unutterable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the very ſoul of prayer, lyes in the pouring out of a mans ſoul before the Lord, though it be but in ſighs, groans, and tears, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13,—19. One ſigh and groan from a broken heart, is better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, than all humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, Beg of God to teach thee to pray. O beg the holy ſpirit that is a ſpirit of prayer. God hath promiſed his holy ſpirit to them that ask it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more ſhall your heavenly father give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him?</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you: and I will takeaway the ſtony heart out of your fleſh and I will give you a heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes; and ye ſhall keep my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:40722:158"/> 
               <hi>and doe them.</hi> Ezek. 11. 19. <hi>And I will give them one heart, &amp; I will put a new Spirit within you; and I will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh.</hi> Zech. 12. 10. <hi>I will pour upon the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Spirit of grace and ſupplication.</hi> Now Gracious promiſes are Gods bonds, and he loves to ſee his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put them in ſuit. God expects <note place="margin">Iſa. 62. 6, 7. Iſa. 42. 25, 26.</note> that we ſhould be his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, and that we ſhould pray over his promiſes. When he had promiſed great things to his people concerning Juſtification, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Preſervation, he ſubjoynes, <hi>Yet, I will for this be enquired of by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the houſe of Iſrael to doe it.</hi> God looks that we ſhould ſpread his gracious promiſes before him, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 37. 14.</note> did <hi>Seanacheribs</hi> letter. God is never better pleaſed than when his people importune him in his own words and urge him with arguments taken from his owne promiſes. Though God be a very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father, and a very liberal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40722:159"/> yet he is not a prodigal father, for he will never throw away his mercies on ſuch as will not ſtoutly and humbly plead out his promiſes with him. God loves to take ſtate upon him, and will be ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, both for his giving in of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and for his making good of precious promiſes. Thou ſayeſt thou can'ſt not pray; why can'ſt thou not goe into a corner, and ſpread the Promiſes laſt cited before the Lord, and tell him how much it concernes his honour &amp; glory as well as thy own internal &amp; eternal good, to make good thoſe gracious promiſes that he hath made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his giving of his Spirit to them that ask him, and his putting his Spirit within them, and his pouring out a Spirit of grace and ſupplication upon them.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Tamar,</hi> that when <note place="margin">Gen. 38. 18,—25.</note> 
               <hi>Judah</hi> her father-in-law lay with her, ſhe took as a pledge his ſignet, bracelets, and ſtaffe; and afterwards when ſhe was in great diſtreſs and ready to be burnt as an Harlot, ſhe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40722:159"/> then brought out her ſtaff, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and Bracelets, and ſaid, <hi>by the man whoſe theſe are, am I with child,</hi> and thereby ſhe ſaved her life. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are as ſo many rich Mines, they are as ſo many choice flowers of paradiſe, they are the food, life, and ſtrength of the ſoul, They are as a ſtaffe to ſupport the ſoul, and they are as a ſignet and Bracelets to adorne the ſoul, and to enrich the ſoul; and therefore poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould bring them forth, and lay them before the Lord, and urge God with them, there being no way on earth to ſave a mans ſoule, and to prevent a burning in Hell like this. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning precious promiſes let me give you theſe eight hints.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they are truly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; ſtated by God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be performed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. they being all made in and thorow Chriſt; they are made firſt to Chriſt, and then to all that have union and communion with him.</p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:40722:160"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Sirtorius,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> paid what he promiſed with fair words: but ſo doth not God. Men many times, ſay and unſay; they often eate their words as ſoon as they have ſpoken them; but God will never eat the words that are gone out of his mouth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 10, 11. <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my pleaſure: yea, I have ſpoken it, I will alſo bring it to paſs, I have purpoſed it, I will alſo doe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That they all iſſue from free grace, from ſpecial love, <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> from divine goodneſs,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they are all as <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 3.</note> unchangable as he is that made them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That they are all bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed and <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> founded upon the truth, faithfulneſs, and all ſufficiency of God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That they are pledges and pawnes of great things that <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> God will doe for his people in time.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That they are moſt <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> ſure and certain evidences of divine
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40722:160"/> favour, and a declaration of the <note place="margin">Num. 23. 19.</note> heart and good will of God to his poor people.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That they are the price of Chriſts blood.</p>
            <p>Now how ſhould all theſe things encourage poor ſouls to be ſtill a preſſing of God with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes! But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You ſay you cannot pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that you would leave off objecting, and fall upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you cannot pray as you would, nor as you ſhould, pray as well as you can. <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren ſtood ſo long dallying &amp; delaying and trifling out the time, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Journey to goe to buy corn, they might have bought and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned twice, before they went and bought once. When <hi>Eliah</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Elizeus</hi> he goes about the buſh, <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 20.</note> and he muſt needs goe bid his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother farewel, before he could follow the Prophet. O friends, take heed of dallying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, trifling, going about
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40722:161"/> the buſh, when you ſhould be a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the work of prayer. What though with <hi>Hannah</hi> thou can'ſt but weep out a prayer, or with <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtammer out a prayer, or with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> chatter out a prayer, yet do as well as thou can'ſt, and thou ſhalt find accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. The Publicans prayer had not much Rhetorick or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in it, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> and yet God accepted it: He <note place="margin">Luke 18. 13.</note> prayed much, though he ſpake lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and God did not turn a deafe ear upon him. That God that once accepted a handfull of meale <note place="margin">Lev. 2. 1, 2. Chap. 6. 15. Luke 21, 3.</note> for a ſacrifice, and a gripe of Goats hair for an oblation, and the poor widows two mites, as if they had been two millions, will certainly accept of what thou art able to do, though thou doſt fall ſhort, yea much ſhort of what thou oughteſt to doe. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:40722:161"/> 
               <hi>me to pray: I cannot pray as I would, yet I will obey: for though my prayer be not acceptable, yet thine own commandement is acceptable to thee.</hi> If weak Chriſtians would but put forth in prayer that little ſtrength they have, God would quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their ſpiritual ſtrength, he would certainly carry them on from ſtrength to ſtrength, he would <note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 29, 30, 31. Pſal. 84. 7.</note> ſtill by ſecret aſſiſtances, and ſecret influences, help them on in their heavenly trade. As a loving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father will take his little Child in his armes, and carry him on in his way home ward, when his ſtrength begins to fail him, and he can walk no further, and the way proves dirty, ſlippery, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even. So doth God by his, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>I taught Ephram alſo to go</hi> (as a nurſe doth the infant) <hi>taking them by their arm.</hi> When Gods poor Children come to a fowl way, or a rough place, he takes them up in his own arms, and helps them over the quagmire of Croſſes, and the difficulties of duties, and over all

            <p>'Tis obſervable, that when the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to ſhoot the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <note place="margin">2 Kings 13. 16.</note> he did put his hand upon the Bow, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> did put his hand upon the Kings hand.

               </gap>h, or rather to our weakneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities,</hi> lifts with us, or helpeth together. The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

When a poor Chriſtian ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40722:162"/> to cloſet prayer, or to mourn, or to believe, or to obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Spirit comes in with new help, and new influences, and new aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſo carryes him on in all theſe noble ſervices. That child that doth but ſtammer at firſt, in time will ſpeak plainly and fluently. O how many Chriſtians are there, that now can pray with much freedom, liberty and fluency, who at firſt could only ſigh out a prayer, or ſtammer out a prayer, or weep out a prayer? Thou ſaieſt thou canſt not pray, but didſt thou but ſtir up thy ſelf to obey that command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. as well as thou canſt thou doſt not know but that a power may go forth with the command, that may enable thee to act ſuitable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? In <hi>Matth</hi> 9. 1,—9. Chriſt bid the Palſie man riſe and walk, <hi>Take up thy bed and go unto thine houſe.</hi> The Palſie man might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>Alas, I am carried by four, I am not able to ſtir a limb, much leſs to riſe, but leaſt of all to take up my bed</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:40722:163"/> 
               <hi>and walk,</hi> &amp;c. Oh but he rouſeth up himſelf as well as he could, and a power went forth with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that enabled him to do what was commanded. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 10,—14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was a poor man that had a withered hand, and Chriſt commands him to ſtretch forth his hand: he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>My hand is withered, and if I might have as many worlds as there be men in the world to ſtretch it forth, I could not ſtretch it forth; yea, if my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life, if my very ſalvation did lie upon ſtretching forth my withered arm, I could not ſtretch it forth:</hi> Oh, but he throws by all ſuch plea's, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with Chriſt's command as well as he could, and a power went forth and healed his hand. O ſirs, if you would but pray in your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets as well as you can, you do not know but that ſuch power and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue might flow from Chriſt into your hearts, as might carry you on in your cloſet duties, beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, even to admiration; others have found it ſo, and why not you,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40722:163"/> why not you? Well remember, that God is no curious nor critical obſerver of the incongruous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that falls from his poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are in their cloſet duties; he is ſuch a father as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleaſed with the broken expreſſions and divine ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his people when they are in a corner. 'Tis not a flood of words, nor ſtudied notions, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphical expreſſions, nor elegant phraſes in prayer, that takes the ear, or that delights the heart of God, or that opens the gates of glory, or that brings down the beſt of bleſſings upon the ſoul; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, holineſs, heavenlyneſs, ſpiritualneſs, and brokenneſs of heart, theſe are the things that make a conqueſt upon God, and that turns moſt to the ſouls ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Thou ſayſt thou canſt not pray: but if thou art a child of God, thou haſt the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is a Spirit of prayer and ſupplication. That all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40722:164"/> the Children of God have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is moſt evident in the bleſſed Scriptures. Take theſe for a taſte, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication.</hi> Pſal. 51. 11. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Ye have received the ſpirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. <hi>We have received, not the Spirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 8. <hi>Who hath given unto us his holy ſpirit.</hi> 1 John 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> Chap. 4. 13. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all the Children of God have the Spirit of God, may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made evident by an induction of theſe ſeven particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are all ſanctified by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit of our God.</hi> I do not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40722:164"/> ſay, that they are all equally ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Spirit, but I ſay, they are all really ſanctified by the Spirit. Though all the ſervants of Chriſt have their Talents, yet all have not <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 15.</note> their ten Talents, nor all have not their five Talents, nor all have not their two Talents, ſome have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their one Talent. Though <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamins</hi> Meſs was five times as much <note place="margin">Gen. 43. 32 33, 34.</note> as his brethrens Meſs, yet every one of his brethren had their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs; ſo though ſome Chriſtians have five times more meaſures of the Spirit, and more meaſures of light, of love, of holineſs, of heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than others have; yet, every Chriſtian hath ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Spirit, and ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace and holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though ſome are Babes in Chriſt, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2. 1 John 2. 12, 13, 14.</note> and others are Children in Chriſt; though ſome are young Men in Chriſt, and others are old Men in Chriſt, yet every one of them is <note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> born of the Spirit of Chriſt. Though none of the people of God in this life have the Spirit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40722:165"/> yet every one of them have ſo much of the Spirit as will bring him to ſalvation; every Chriſtian hath ſo much of the Spirit as will bring Chriſt and his Soul together: and therefore without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, every Chriſtian hath ſo much of the Spirit, as will at laſt bring Heaven and his Soul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are all led by the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi> Every Child of God hath a twofold Guide; the Word without, and the Spirit within, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20, 21. How the Spirit leads by the rule of the Word, and how he leads <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 22. Epheſ. 5. 9.</note> to God, and leads to Chriſt, and leads to Truth, and leads to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and leads to Holineſs, and leads to Happineſs, I ſhall not now undertake to ſhew.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are all upheld &amp; ſtrengthned by the Spirit, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me with thy free Spirit;</hi> or underprop me, or ſuſtain me, as the Hebrew hath it, with thy free vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40722:165"/> Spirit; or as the Greek turns it, with thy noble princely Spirit. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>To be ſtrengthned with might by his Spirit in the inner man.</hi> By the inner man, ſome underſtand the regenerate part of man; others by the inner man, do underſtand the ſoul with all its noble faculties and motions. Take the words which way you will, 'tis certain that all the ſpiritual might and ſtrength that a Chriſtian hath, he hath it from the holy Spirit. Though the Spirit ſtrengthens eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian in the inner man, yet I do not ſay that the Spirit ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens every Chriſtian alike in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. Some have ſtronger corruptions to ſubdue than others, and more violent temptations to with-ſtand than others, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulties to wreſtle with than others, and choicer mercies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove than others, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and harder duties of Religion to mannage than others, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they are more ſtrengthned in the inner man than others.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:40722:166"/>
            <p> Fourthly, They are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Our ſelves have the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of the Spirit;</hi> which are but as a handful of corn in reſpect of the whole crop. All the grace, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 22.</note> and all the holineſs which we have from the regenerating Spirit at firſt converſion, is but a drop to that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a a mite to thoſe Talents which we ſhall receive in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They are all taught by <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 21.</note> the Spirit. <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. <hi>The holy-Ghoſt whom the father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This promiſe primarily belongs to the Apoſtles;</p>
            <p>Secondarily to all believers.</p>
            <p>Though theſe words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at firſt to the Apoſtles only, yet they were not ſpoken of the Apoſtles only, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. In the words there are three things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Immediate illumination by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A full knowledge of all thoſe truths belonging to their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40722:166"/> Apoſtolical office, and that were neceſſary for them at that juncture of time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Abſolute infallibility as to matter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There are alſo three things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to all beleevers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Mediate illumination, teaching truths by the Spirit of truth, in the uſe of the meanes of grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Knowledge of all truth neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, infallibility too, ſo far forth as they adhere and keep cloſe to the ſpirits teaching in the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, That the primitive Chriſtians were called <hi>Tillers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as husbandmen till their fields and manure their grounds, ſo did they teach their Families, and nurture their Children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with good inſtructions O what choice teachings of the ſpirit were theſe primitive Chriſtians under, who made it ſo much their buſineſs, their work, to teach thoſe that were under their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40722:167"/> charge. So <hi>John.</hi> 1. 2, 27. <hi>But the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 9. 2 Cor. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth.</hi> Not that we know all things ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or that we need not a Miniſtry to teach and inſtruct us; but he ſpeaks comparatively; you ſhall not be ſo helped by any inſtructions without the Spirit, as with the Spirit. The Spirit ſhall declare the truth as it is in Jeſus, more clearly, more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more particularly, more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, more univerſally, more <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Tim. 4. 1. John 16. 25 Iſa. 48 17. Eccl. 11. 5.</note> effectually, than any other is able to doe. The Spirit, this holy uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall teach the Saints all things; not all things knowable, for that is impoſſible for finite creatures to attain unto. Who knows the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heavens, the influences of the ſtars, the nature of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or how the bones doe grow in the womb of her that is with child? who knowes the reaſon why the River <hi>Nilus</hi> ſhould overflow in the ſummer, when waters are at the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40722:167"/> loweſt; or why the load-ſtone ſhould draw Iron to it, or incline to the <hi>Pole-ſtar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of one that ſpent <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> eight and fifty years in learning out the nature of the Bee, and yet had not fully attained to it. How is it poſſible then for the wiſeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt to enter into the deep things of God!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> that learned his divinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9, 10, 11.</note> the Angels, and that had the holy-Ghoſt for his immediate teacher, tells us plainly <hi>That he knew but in part;</hi> and O then, how little a part of that part do we know! But the Spirit teacheth the Saints all things: that is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, He teacheth them all things needful for the ſalvation of their ſouls, all things neceſſary to bring <note place="margin">John 17. 3.</note> them to heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All things needful to life and godlyneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all things needful to their places, callings, ſexes, ages, and conditions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All things needful
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40722:168"/> for you to know, to preſerve you in the truth, and to preſerve you from being deluded and ſeduced by thoſe falſe teachers of whom he ſpeaks, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 22, 23, 26.

But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They are all comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9. 31. <hi>They</hi>

               <hi>Hudſon</hi> the Martyr being deſerted at the ſtake, went from under his chain; and having prayed earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was comforted immediatly, and ſuffered valiantly.</p>

               <hi>Rachel</hi> wept, and would not be comforted; ſhe gave ſo much way to weeping, that ſhe would not give the leaſt way to comfort: and ſo 'tis many times with the choic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saints. <hi>My ſoul refuſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi>

The Spirit many times car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes on his ſanctifying work in the ſoul, when he doth not carry on his comforting work in the ſoul; the Spirit many times acts in a way

               </gap>pecial ſealing times. As Firſt Converſion times are often the Spirits ſealing times. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22, 23. Upon the Prodigals return the fatted Calf is killed, and the beſt Robe is put upon his back, and the Ring is put upon his hand, and ſhooes on his feet. Some by the Robe underſtand the Royalty of <hi>Adam,</hi> others, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And by the Ring, ſome underſtand the pledges of Gods love, Rings being given as pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of love: and by the Ring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underſtand the ſeal of Gods holy Spirit, men uſeing to ſeal with their Rings. Among the <hi>Romans</hi> the Ring was an enſigne of vertue, honour, and nobility, whereby they that wore them were diſtinguiſhed from the common people. I think the main thing intended by the Robe and the Ring, is to ſhew us,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40722:172"/> that God ſometimes upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners converſion and returning to him, is graciouſly pleaſed to give him ſome choice manifeſtations of his gracious pleaſure and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and to ſeal up to him his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love and favour. And hence it comes to paſs that ſome that are but babes in Chriſt, are <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2, 3. 1. John 2. 12, 13, 14. Acts 9. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> ſo diligent and active in religious duties, and ſo conſciencious and dexterous in the exerciſe of their Graces. At firſt converſion, God helps ſome of his people to read their own names written in legible letters in the Book of Life: No ſooner are ſome converted, but the Spirit ſtamps his ſeale upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Beleeving times are ſealing times, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. When they were in the very exerciſe of their faith, when they were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> of their faith (for ſo much the Original imports) the Spirit came and ſealed them up to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. He that honours Chriſt by frequent actings of faith on him, him will Chriſt honour, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40722:172"/> his ſeal and mark upon him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Humbling times, mourning times, are ſealing times. When a holy man was askt, which were the joyfulleſt dayes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableſt dayes, that ever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, he anſwered, his mourning dayes. His mourning dayes were his joyfulleſt dayes; and therefore he cried out, <hi>O give me my mourning dayes, give me my mourning dayes, for they were my joyfulleſt dayes.</hi> Thoſe were dayes wherein God ſealed up his everlaſting love to his ſoul, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 19. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal had greatly humbled himſelf before his father, then the beſt Robe and the Ring were put upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17,—24. There are none that long for the ſealings of the Spirit, like humble ſouls; nor none ſet ſo high a price upon the ſealings of the Spirit, as humble ſouls; nor none make ſo choice an improvement of the ſealings of the Spirit, as humble ſouls. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when mens hearts are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40722:173"/> and low, the Spirit comes and ſets the privy ſeal of heaven upon them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Sin-killing, ſin-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, ſin-ſubduing times are the Spirits ſealing times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, that no man knowes ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God will give to the victorious Chriſtian a ſecret love-token, whereby his ſoul may reſt aſſured of the unſpeakable love of God, and of its freedom from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. White<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtones were of very great uſe among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and ſerved to acquit the accuſed in Courts of Juſtice. When Malefactors were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, arraigned and condemned in their Courts, they gave them a Black ſtone in token of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when they were acquitted they gave them White ſtones, in token of abſolution: And to this practiſe the holy Ghoſt ſeems to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40722:173"/> allude. He that is victorious over <note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 5.</note> his luſts ſhall have a new Name, <hi>that is better than the names of ſons and daughters;</hi> and he ſhall have the pardon of his ſins writ in fair let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the white ſtone, ſo that he may run and read his abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The victorious Chriſtian ſhall <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7.</note> have aſſurance of the full diſcharge of all his ſins, he ſhall have a clear evidence of his Juſtification, and a bleſſed aſſurance of his eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; all which are hidden and myſterious things to all but thoſe that have experienced and taſted what theſe ſweet meats of Heaven mean.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romans</hi> there were ſolemn feaſts held in honour of thoſe that were victorious in their ſacred Games. Now thoſe that were to be admitted to thoſe Feaſts were wont to have their names written on white ſhels, and white ſtones, and by theſe Tickets they were admitted. Now ſome think the holy Ghoſt alludes to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and ſo would hint to us a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40722:174"/> privy mark whereby victorious Chriſtians may be known, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as bidden gueſts to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly banquet of the hidden Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9. O ſirs, when predominate luſts are brought under, when boſom ſins lye ſlain in the ſoul, then the Spirit comes and ſeals up love, and life, and glory, to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Suffering times are ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55, 56, 59, 60. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15, 16, 17. The primitive Chriſtians found <note place="margin">Acts 5. 40, 41, 42. Pſal. 71. 20, 21. &amp; Pſal. 94. 19. Rev. 1. 9, 10.</note> them ſo, and the ſuffering Saints in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Marian</hi> dayes found them ſo. When the Furnace is ſeven times hotter than ordinary, the Spirit of the Lord comes and ſeals up a mans pardon in his boſom, and his peace with God, and his title to heaven. When the world frowns moſt then God ſmiles moſt; when the world puts their iron chains upon the Saints legs, then God puts his golden chains about the Saints necks; when the world puts a bitter cup into one hand, then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40722:174"/> the Lord puts a cup of conſolation into the other hand; when the world cries out, <hi>Crucifiè them, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them,</hi> then commonly they hear that ſweet voice from heaven, <hi>Theſe are my beloved ones, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed <hi>Bradford,</hi> looked upon his ſufferings as an evidence to him that he was in the right way to heaven. And, ſaith <hi>Ignatius, It is better for me to be a Martyr, than to be a Monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Self-denying times are the Spirits ſealing times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is ſinful ſelf, which takes in a mans luſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is natural ſelf which takes in a mans arts, parts, gifts, with Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is religious ſelf, which takes in all a mans religious duties and ſervices, whether ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is moral ſelf which includes a freedome from groſs, hainous, enormous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40722:175"/> and a fair, ſweet, harmleſs behaviour towards men.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is relative ſelf, which takes in our neareſt and deareſt relations in the fleſh; as <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> Wife, Children, Father, Mother, Brothers, Siſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when a man comes thus univerſally to deny himſelf for Chriſt's ſake, and the Goſpels ſake, and Religion ſake, then the Spirit of the Lord comes and ſeals him up unto the day of redemption. This is a truth confirmed by the experiences of many Martyrs now in Heaven, and by the teſtimony of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſtill alive.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Sacrament times are ſealing times. In that feaſt of fat things, God by his Spirit ſeals up his love to his people, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to his people, and pardon of ſin to his people, and heaven and happineſs to his people. There are many precious ſouls that have found Chriſt in this Ordinance, when they could not find him in other Ordinances, though they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40722:175"/> have ſought him ſorrowingly. In this Ordinance many a diſtreſſed ſoul hath been ſtrengthned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and ſealed.</p>
            <p>I might give you many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; take one for all. There was a gracious woman, who, after God had filled her ſoul with comfort, and ſealed up his everlaſting love to her, fell under former fears and trouble of Spirit; and being at the Lords Supper, a little before the bread was adminiſtred to her, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſeemed to appear to her, and told her that ſhe ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to eat; but at that very nick of time, the Lord was pleaſed to bring into her mind that paſſage in the <hi>Canticles, Eat, O my friends.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 1.</note> But notwithſtanding this, Satan ſtill continued terrifying of her; and when ſhe had eaten, he told her that ſhe ſhould not drink; but then the Lord brought that ſecond clauſe of the Verſe to her remembrance, <hi>Drink, yea, drink abundantly</hi> (or, be drunk, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) <hi>my beloved</hi> (or, my loves, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:40722:176"/> hath it. All faithful ſouls are Chriſts Loves) and ſo ſhe drank al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and preſently was filled with ſuch unſpeakable joyes, that ſhe hardly knew how ſhe got home: Which ſoul-raviſhing joyes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for a fortnight after, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her mouth with ſongs of praiſe, ſo that ſhe could neither ſleep, nor eat, more than ſhe forced her ſelf to do out of conſcience of duty. At the fortnights end, when God was pleaſed to abate her meaſure of joy, ſhe came to a ſetled peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and aſſurance of the love of God; ſo that for twenty years after ſhe had not ſo much as a cloud upon her ſpirit, or the leaſt queſtioning of her intereſt in Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, When God calls his people to ſome great and noble work, when he puts them upon ſome high ſervices, ſome difficult duties, ſome holy and eminent imployments, then his Spirit comes and ſets his ſeal upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Before I formed thee in the belly, I</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:40722:176"/> 
               <hi>knew thee; and before thou cameſt forth out of the womb, I ſanctifyed thee, and I ordained thee to be a prophet unto the Nations.</hi> The Lord ſending the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to denounce moſt dreadful judgements againſt a rebellious people, an impudent brazen-faced Nation, he aſſures him of his eternal election, and of his choice preſence, and ſingular aſſiſtance in that work that he ſet him about, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 17, 18, 19. Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 17. 1, to the 6th, and thus he dealt with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9, to 23.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, When they are taken up into more than ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, then is the Spirits ſealing time. When was it that the Spouſe cried out, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> but when Chriſt brought her to his banquetting houſe, and his banner over her was love? <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. 3, 4, 5, 6. compared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, and laſtly, When Chriſtians give themſelves up to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40722:177"/> private prayer, when Chriſtians are more than ordinarily exerciſed in ſecret prayer, in Cloſet duties, then the Spirit comes and ſeals up the Covenant and the Love of the Father to them. When <hi>Daniel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 20, 21, 22, 23.</note> had been wreſtling and weeping, and weeping and wreſtling all day long with God in his Cloſet, then the Angel tells him, <hi>that he was a man greatly beloved of God,</hi> or <hi>a man of great deſires,</hi> as the Original hath it. There was a gracious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who after much frequenting of Sermons, and walking in the ways of the Lord, fell into great deſertions, but being in ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, God came in with abundance of light and comfort, ſealing up to her ſoul that part of his Covenant, <hi>viz. I will take the ſtony heart out of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh; that they may walk in my ſtatutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> And thus I have given you a brief account of the Spirits ſpecial ſealing times.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:40722:177"/>
            <p> Now mark, This ſeal God ſets upon all his wares, upon all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted children; for ſooner or later there are none of his but are ſealed with this ſeal. God ſets his <note place="margin">John 3. 3. 2 Theſſ. 2. 13. Heb. 12. 14.</note> ſeal of Regeneration, he ſtamps his Image of Holineſs upon all his people, to difference and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from all prophane, moral, and hypocritical perſons in the World. Doubtleſs the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying work of the Holy Ghoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing the draughts and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods Image of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Holineſs upon Man, as a ſeal or ſignet doth leave an impreſſion and ſtamp of its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the thing ſealed, is the ſeal of the Spirit ſpoken of in Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his. And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> But to prevent miſtakes, you muſt remember, that though the Spirit of the Lord, firſt or laſt, will ſet his ſeal upon every real Saint,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40722:178"/> yet the impreſſion of that ſeal is not alike viſible in all; for ſome bear this impreſſion as Babes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as men grown up to ſome maturity. All Gods adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bear this impreſſion truly, but none of them bear it perfectly in this life. Sometimes this ſeal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, this ſeal of Holineſs is ſo plain and obvious that a man may run &amp; read it in himſelf and others; and at other times 'tis ſo obſcure and dark, that he can hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it, either in himſelf or others. This ſeal is ſo lively ſtampt on ſome of Gods people, that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf very viſibly, eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gloriouſly; but on others it is not alike viſible. And thus I have made it evident by theſe ſeven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that all the children of God, have the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Now mark, The Spirit of God that is in all the Saints is a Spirit of prayer and ſupplication, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Ye have received the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> While the child is in the womb it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40722:178"/> cannot cry, but as ſoon as it is born it cries. Whilſt <hi>Paul</hi> did lie in the womb of his natural eſtate, he could not pray; but no ſooner was he born of the ſpirit, but the next news is, <hi>Behold he prayeth! Acts.</hi> 9. 11. Prayer is nothing but the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans inſide outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. The very ſoul of prayer lyes in the pouring out of a mans ſoul into the boſome of God. Prayer is nothing but the breathing that out before the Lord, that was firſt breath'd into us by the ſpirit of the Lord Prayer is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a choice, a free, a ſweet, and familiar intercourſe of the ſoul with God. Certainly, it is a great work of the Spirit to help the Saints to pray, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe you are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> God hath no ſtill-born chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The Gemination <hi>Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> notes fiduciall, filial, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement affection. The firſt is an <note place="margin">Pareus.</note> Hebrew or Syriack word, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Greek, whereby is ſignified
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40722:179"/> the union of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in one Church, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> What is <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba?</hi> ſay others, in <hi>Hebrew, Father,</hi> and it is added, becauſe in Chriſt the corner ſtone both peoples are joyned, alike becoming ſons, whence ſoever they come; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion from one place, whereupon <hi>Abba,</hi> uncircumciſion from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereupon <hi>father</hi> is named: The concord of the walls being the glory of the corner ſtone.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Abba</hi> ſay others, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, which the Apoſtle here retaineth, becauſe it is a word full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which young children retain almoſt in all Languages, when they begin to ſpeak. And he adds the word <hi>Father,</hi> not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame, but alſo the better to expreſs the eager movings, and the earneſt and vehement deſires and ſingular affection of beleevers, in their crying unto God; even as Chriſt himſelf redoubled the <note place="margin">Mark 14. 36.</note> word <hi>Father</hi> to the ſame purpoſe,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40722:179"/> when he was in his greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. This little word <hi>Father,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> liſped forth in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by a Child of God, exceeds the eloquence of <hi>Demoſthenes, Cicero,</hi> and all other ſo famed Orators in the World. 'Tis certain that the Spirit of God helps the Saints in all their communions with God, <hi>viz.</hi> in their meditations of God, in their reading and hearing of the Word of God, in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions one with another, and in all their ſolemn addreſſes to God. And as to this the Apoſtle gives us a moſt ſpecial inſtance in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> When we are to pray, there is in us ſometimes an infirmity of ignorance, ſo that we know not what to pray for, either in regard of the matter or the manner. And there is in us at other times an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of pride and conceitedneſs,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40722:180"/> ſo that we cannot pray with that humility and lowlineſs of ſpirit as we ſhould, ſpiritual pride having fly-blown our prayers. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is in us an infirmity of deadneſs, dullneſs, drowſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that we cannot pray with that warmth, heat, life, ſpirit, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, as we ſhould, or as we would; and at other times there is in us an infirmity of unbelief and ſlaviſh fears, ſo that we cannot pray with that faith and holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as becomes Children that draw near to a Throne of Grace, to a Throne of Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now the Spirit helps theſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by way of inſtruction, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting, and teaching us what to pray for, and how we ſhould ſpell our leſſon; and by telling us as it were within, what we ſhould ſay, and how we ſhould ſigh and groan; and by rouſing and quickening, and ſtirring of us up to prayer; and by his ſingular influence and choice aſſiſtance opening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging our hearts in prayer; and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40722:180"/> by his tuning the Strings of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he prepares us and fits us for the work of Supplication: And therefore every one that derides the Spirit of prayer in the Saints (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe are the men and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that pray by the Spirit) blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme againſt the holy Spirit; it being a main work of the Spirit to teach the Saints to pray, and to help them in prayer. Now all the Saints having the Spirit, and the Spirit being a Spirit of prayer and ſupplication, there is no reaſon in the world why a Saint ſhould ſay, I would pray in ſecret, but I can't pray, I can't pour out my ſoul, nor my complaint before the Lord in a corner.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Thou ſayeſt thou canſt not pray, thou haſt not the gifts and parts which others have: But thou canſt mannage thy callings thy worldly buſineſſe as well as others; and why then canſt thou not pray as well as others? Ah friends, did you but love private prayer as well as you love the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40722:181"/> world, and delight in private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as much as you delight in the world, and were your hearts as much ſet upon cloſet prayer as they are ſet upon the world, you would never ſay you could not pray, yea, you would quickly pray as well as others; 'tis not ſo much from want of ability to pray in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that you don't pray in ſecret; as 'tis from want of a will, a heart to pray in ſecret, that you don't pray in ſecret. <hi>Jacobs</hi> love to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> and <hi>Sechems</hi> love to <hi>Dina,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">Gen. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> ch 34.</note> them through the greateſt difficulties. Were mens affections but ſtrongly ſet upon private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they would quickly find abilities to pray. He that ſets his affections upon a Virgin (though he be not learned nor eloquent) will find words enough to let her know how his heart is taken with her. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is eaſie. He in <hi>Seneca</hi> complained of a Thorn in his foot, when his Lungs was rotten. So many complain of want of ability to pray in their cloſets, when
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40722:181"/> their hearts are rotten. Sirs, do but get better hearts, and then you will never ſay you can't pray. 'Tis one of the ſaddeſt ſights in all the world, to ſee men ſtrongly part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gifted for all worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to cry out that they can't pray, that they have no ability to pour out their ſouls before the Lord in ſecret. You have ſufficient parts and gifts to tell men of your ſins, your wants, your dangers, your difficulties, your mercies, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, your duties, your croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, your loſſes, your enjoyments, your friends, your foes; and why then are you not aſhamed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your want of parts and gifts, to tell thoſe very things to God in a corner, which you can tell to men even upon the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, &amp;c. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some may further <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obj. 4."/> object and ſay, God is very well acquainted with all our wants, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, ſtraits, tryals; and there is no moving of him to beſtow any favours upon us, which he doth not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40722:182"/> intend to beſtow upon us, whether we pray in our cloſets or no; and therefore to what purpoſe do you preſſe ſecret prayer ſo hard upon us? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this Objection I ſhall give theſe Anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this Objection lyes as ſtrong againſt Family Prayer, and Publick Prayer, as it doth againſt Private Prayer. God knows all thy wants and neceſſities, all thy ſtraits and tryals, &amp;c. and therefore what needeſt thou pray in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, what needeſt thou attend Publick Prayers in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints. There is no wringing of any mercy out of the hands of Heaven, which God doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to beſtow: This Objection fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all kind of Prayer, and fights againſt all kinds of Prayer. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayer is that piece of Divine Worſhip and Adoration, 'tis a part of that homage, which we owe to God upon the account of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command (as I have already
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40722:182"/> proved.) Now all Objections muſt bow before the face of Divine Commands; As <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren bowed before him: Or as King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 6. Eſth. 3. 2.</note> his ſervants bowed before <hi>Haman.</hi> Indeed every Objection that is formed up againſt a Divine Command, ſhould fall before it, as <hi>Dagon</hi> fell before the Ark, or as <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> fell before <hi>David.</hi> He that caſts off Private Prayer under any pretence whatſoever, he caſts off the Dominion of God, the Authority of God, and this may be as much as a mans life and ſoul is worth. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, Though Prayer be not the ground, the cauſe of obtaining favours and mercies from God; yet 'tis the means, 'tis the Silver Channel, 'tis the Golden Pipe, through which the Lord is <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 6. Jam. 1. 5. Iſa. 62. 7. Pſal. 22. 24.</note> pleaſed to convey to his people all temporal, Spiritual, and eternal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. from the 26. verſe, to the 37. verſe of that Chapter. God promiſes to give them the cream, the choyceſt, the ſweeteſt,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40722:183"/> of all ſpiritual, eternal, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings; but mark, verſe 37. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> Though God be very prompt and ready to beſtow upon his people the beſt and the greateſt of bleſſings; yet the will by prayer be ſought unto for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual enjoyment of them. He that hath no heart to pray for a mercy he needs, he hath no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ever God will give him the mercy he needs. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, without asking; no finding, without ſeeking; no opening, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knocking. The threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed to the threefold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all Chriſtians to be inſtant, fervent, and conſtant in prayer. The proud beggar gets nothing of men; and the dumb ſinner gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God. As there is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy too great for God to give; ſo there is no mercy too little for us to crave. Certainly that man hath little worth in him, that thinks any mercy not worth a ſeeking. But,</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:40722:183"/>
            <p> Fourthly and laſtly, I anſwer, Every Chriſtian ſhould labour to enjoy his mercies in mercy, he ſhould labour to have his bleſſings bleſt unto him, he ſhould labour <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 17.</note> to have the good-will of him that dwelt in the buſh with all he hath. Now this is an everlaſting truth, a maxim to live and die with; that whatſoever mercy comes not in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wing of prayer, is not given in mercy. O how ſweet is that mercy that comes flying in upon the wing of prayer: How ſweet was that water to <hi>Sampſon</hi> which ſtreamed to him in the channel of private prayer, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 19. he called the name of it, <hi>En-hakkore,</hi> the Well of him that prayed. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> prayed as for life, and that water that was handed to him was as ſweet as life. Every mercy that is gathered by the hand of prayer, is as ſweet as the Roſe of <hi>Sharon:</hi> But <note place="margin">Can. 2. 1.</note> that mercy that comes not in at the door of prayer, comes not in at the right door; and that mercy that comes not in at the right door, will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40722:184"/> do a man no good; ſuch mercies will make themſelves wings and fly from us. Every Chriſtian ſhould <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 5.</note> narrowly look that all his mercies <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 4, 5.</note> are ſanctified mercies; now every mercy is ſanctified by the word &amp; prayer: Prayer prepares and fits us for mercy, and mercy for us: 'Tis Prayer that gives us a right and holy uſe of all our mercies: Such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are but great miſeries that come not in upon the wing of prayer: Prayerleſs mens mercies are all given in wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 23,—32. Yea their bleſſings are curſt unto them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 33. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2. Look as every ſacrifice was to be ſeaſoned with ſalt; ſo every mercy is to be ſanctified by prayer. Look as Gold ſometimes is laid, not only upon cloath and ſilks, but alſo upon Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf: So Prayer is that Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en duty, that muſt be laid, not only upon all our natural and civil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as eating, drinking, buying, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c. but alſo upon all our Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver duties, upon all our moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſpiritual performances, as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40722:184"/> hearing, reading, meditating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, church-fellowſhip, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly prayer is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make every providence, and every ordinance, and every mercy to be a bleſſing to us. Every mercy that comes in upon the wing of private prayer is a double mercy; 'tis a great-bellied mercy, 'tis a mercy that hath many mereies in the womb of it. Happy is that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that can lay his hand upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mercy that he enjoyes, and ſay of them all as once <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaid of her <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 27. <hi>For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Some may further object <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obj. 5."/> and ſay, I would drive a private trade with God, I would exerciſe my ſelf in ſecret prayer, but I want a convenient place to retire into, I want a private corner to unboſome my ſoul to my Father in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Objection I ſhall give theſe three ſhort Anſwers.</p>
            <pb n="258" facs="tcp:40722:185"/>
            <p> Firſt, I ſuppoſe this Objection concernes but a few Chriſtians in our dayes. That God that hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a Chriſt to Believers, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly give them a convenient cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> to enjoy private communion with himſelf in. Moſt Chriſtians I am afraid do rather want a heart for private prayer, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place for private prayer. What men ſet their hearts upon they will find time and place to effect it, whether it be good or whether it be evil, whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns temporals or ſpirituals, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it concerns this world or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world, this life or a better life. If moſt men would but get better hearts, they would quickly find or make convenient places for private prayer. He who hath an inflamed love to God, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find out a corner to enjoy ſecret communion with God. True lovers will find out corners to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy one another in. How many men are there that can eaſily find out private places for their dogs to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40722:185"/> lye in, and their ſwine to ſleep in, and their horſes to ſtand in, and their oxen to feed in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who can't find out a private place to ſeek the face of God in? But did theſe men but love their God, or their ſouls, or private prayer, or eternity, as well, or better than their beaſts, they would not be ſuch brui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, but that they would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find out a hole, a corner, to wait upon the Lord in. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, If a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be on the top of the houſe with <hi>Peter,</hi> he may pray there; or if he be walking in the field with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he may pray there; or if he be on the mountain with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he may pray there; or if he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the door with <hi>Paul,</hi> he may pray there; or if he be waiting at table with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly pray there; or if he be in a wood, he may pray there, as the primitive Chriſtians in times of perſecution did; or if he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a tree, he may pray there; or if he be by the Sea ſide, he may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40722:186"/> pray there, as the Apoſtles did: 'Twas a choice ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Every Saint is Gods Temple</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and he that carryes his temple about him, may go to prayer when he pleaſeth.</hi> Some Saints have never had ſo much of heaven brought down into their hearts, as when they have been with God in a corner: O the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manifeſtations of divine love, the ſecret kiſſes, the ſecret embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſecret influences, the ſecret communion with God, that many a precious Chriſtian hath had in the moſt ſolitary places, it may be behind the door, or behind the wall, or behind the hedge, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the arbour, or behind the tree, or behind the rock, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the buſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, didſt thou never in thy unregenerate eſtate make uſe of all thy wits, and parts, and utmoſt endeavours, to find out convenient ſeaſons, and ſecret corners, and ſolitary places to ſin in, and to diſhonour thy God in, and to undoe thine owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40722:186"/> ſouls in? yes, I remember with ſhame and bluſhing, that 'twas ſo with me when I was dead in <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> treſpaſſes and ſins, and walked according to the courſe of this world. O how much then doth it concern thee in thy renewed, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and raiſed eſtate, to make uſe of all thy wits, and parts, and utmoſt endeavours, to find out the fitteſt ſeaſons, and the moſt ſecret corners, and ſolitary places thou canſt to honour thy God in, and to ſeek the welfare of thine owne and others ſouls in! O that men were but as ſerious, ſtudious and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to find out convenient ſeaſons, ſecret places to pleaſe, and ſerve, and glorifie the Lord in; as they have been ſerious, ſtudious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to find out convenient ſeaſons, and ſecret places to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe and grieve the Spirit of the Lord in. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, others may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obj. 6."/> further object and ſay, we would be often in private with God, we would give our ſelves up to cloſet
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40722:187"/> prayer, but that we can no ſooner ſhut our cloſet doors, but a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of infirmities, weakneſſes, and vanities doe face us, and riſe up againſt us; our hearts being full of diſtempers and follies; and our bodies, ſay ſome, are under great indiſpoſitions; and our ſouls, ſay others, are under preſent indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and how then can we ſeek the face of God in a corner? how can we wreſtle with God in our cloſets? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40722:188"/> who daily feel and lament over that body of ſin and death that they bare about with them; yea, they do affirme that which is quite contrary to the very ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all the Saints in this life. In every Saint the fleſh; luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other; ſo that they cannot do the things <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> that they would: In every good <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</note> man there are two men, the old man and the new; the one muſt be daily put on, and the other dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put off: All Saints have a law in their members rebelling againſt the law of their minds; ſo that the <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23. 15. comp.</note> good that they would doe, they do not; and the evil that they would not do, that they do: They have two contrary principles in them, from whence proceeds two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of actions, motions, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, continually oppoſite one to another; hence it is that there is a continual combat in them, like the ſtrugling of the Twins in <hi>Rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah's</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:40722:188"/> womb. An abſolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is peculiar to the triumphant ſtate of Gods Elect in Heaven: Heaven is the onely priviledged place, where no unclean thing can <note place="margin">Rev. 23. 21</note> enter in; that's the only place where neither ſin nor Satan ſhall ever get footing. Such as dream of an abſolute perfection in this life, do confound and jumble hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 22, 23.</note> and earth together; the ſtate of the Church militant, with the ſtate of the Church Triumphant, which are certainly diſtinct both in time and place, and in order, meaſure, and concomitants. This dangerous opinion of abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this life, ſhakes the very foundation of Religion, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Goſpel of grace; it renders the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and all his great tranſactions null and void; it tells the world that there is no need of faith, of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of ordinances, of watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: They that ſay they have no ſin, ſay, they have no need of the blood of Chriſt to cleanſe them <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7</note>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40722:189"/> from ſin: Such as ſay they have no ſin, ſay, they have no need of Faith to reſt upon Chriſt for impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs to juſtifie their perſons: Such as ſay they have no <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21. 1 Theſ. 1. ult.</note> ſin, ſay, they have no need of Chriſt as King to ſubdue their luſts; nor as Prieſt, to expiate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; nor as Prophet to teach and inſtruct them; nor as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to ſave them from their ſins, or from wrath to come. They that have a perfect righteouſneſſe of their own, need not be be holden to Chriſt for his pure, perfect, ſpotleſs, matchleſſe Righteouſneſſe: Such as are without ſin have no cauſe to repent of ſin, nor yet to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin: Such as are perfect can't ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants. But are they indeed juſt? then they muſt live by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. Are they men and not Angels? then they muſt repent, <hi>Acts</hi>

An abſolute perfection is not a ſtep ſhort of heaven, 'tis heaven on this ſide heaven; and they that would obtain it muſt ſtep to heaven before they have it. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer. That this Objection lyes as ſtrong againſt Family prayer, and againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of prayer, as it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt cloſet prayer: He that ſhall upon any grounds make this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection a great bug-bear to ſcare his ſoul from Cloſet Prayer; he may upon the ſame ground make it a great bug-bear to ſcare his ſoul not only from all other kind of prayer, but from all other duties of Religion alſo, whether private or publick. The Spirit of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40722:190"/> fights againſt all Religion at once; and therefore you ſhould ſay to it, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Sathan.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, 'Tis not the infirmities and weakneſſes of a Chriſtian which are ſeen, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bewailed and reſiſted, that can <note place="margin">A Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the ſickneſs or indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Soul, that ariſes from weakneſs of Grace.</note> obſtruct or hinder the efficacy and ſucceſſe of his prayers: Let me clear up this in a few inſtances. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> you know was a man full of ſinful paſſions, and other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet his prayer was very prevalent with God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 1, 2, 7, 10. compared. So <hi>Elias</hi> his prayers were exceeding preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with God, he could open and ſhut heaven at his pleaſure; and yet <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 17.</note> ſubject to like paſſions as we are: <hi>Elias</hi> was a man of extraordinary ſanctity and holineſſe, a man that <note place="margin">1 King 19. 8. Rom. 11 2, 3.</note> lived in heaven, whileſt he dwelt on earth, <hi>Enech-like</hi> he walked with God, and yet ſubject to like paſſions as we are: God did in an eminent way communicate to him
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40722:190"/> his counſel and ſecrets; he lay in the boſome of the father; and yet was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are: He was a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and prevalent Prophet; his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name imports as much: <hi>Eli-jah</hi> ſignifies my ſtrong God. In that 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 1. it is <hi>Eli-jahu,</hi> that is, the Lord he is my ſtrong God; and yet ſubject to like paſſions as we are: He was a man much in faſting and prayer; he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour mediator between God and his people, and yet ſubject to like paſſions as we are. Now becauſe ſome from hence might object and ſay, no wonder if ſuch a man as he was, could by his prayers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and ſhut heaven at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but I am a poor, weak, low, ſinful and unworthy creature; I am full of infirmities, weakneſſes and paſſions; and ſhall my prayers ever find acceſs to God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, or gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and returnes from God? Now to obviate this objection, and to remove this diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40722:191"/> out of the thoughts and hearts of poor ſinners, the Holy-Ghoſt addeth this clauſe, that he was not a God, nor an Angel, but a man, and ſuch a man as was not exempted from common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for he had his paſſions, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; weakneſſes, as well as other Saints; intimating to us, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in the meaneſt Saints ſhould no more prejudice the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and ſucceſs of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with God, than they did in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> himſelf. The word <hi>Peſſion</hi> ſometimes ſignifies, Firſt, a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſenſual appetite, ariſing from the imagination of good or ill, with ſome commotion of the body. Secondly, Sometimes <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> ſigniſie ſinful infirmities, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perturbations of the mind. And Thirdly, Sometimes <hi>Paſſion</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more ſtrictly for the ſpecial affection of ſinful anger and wrath, which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls <hi>Brevis Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> a ſhort Divel. It makes a man ſpeak he knows not what, as you may ſee in <hi>Jonah;</hi> and to do he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40722:191"/> knows not what, as you may ſee in <hi>Saul.</hi> Now in theſe two laſt ſences, <hi>Elias</hi> was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are; and yet a man ſo potent with God, that by private prayer he could do even what he liſted in the Court of Heaven. In that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. <hi>chap.</hi> You may read of <hi>Davids</hi> round lyes, and of his other failings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and unſeemly carriages before <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> and for which he was turned out of the Kings preſence under the notion of a Mad-man; and yet at that very time he prayes and prevails with God for ſavour, mercy and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 4. <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me out of all my fears.</hi> But when was this? read the Title of the Pſalm, and you ſhall find it; <hi>A Pſalm of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, who changed his behaviour before Abimilech, who drove him away, and he departed.</hi> In that <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Moſes</hi> his infirmities are point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out: Firſt, You have there his immoderate anger. 2. His ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

His ſmiting of it, when he ſhould only have ſpoken to it with the Rod in his hand; and ſmiting it twice, as in a pang of paſſion and impatiency. 4. his diſtruſting of the Lords word, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. 5. His reviling of the people when he ſhould have convinced them, <hi>hear ye Rebels.</hi> 6. He ſeemes to be ſo offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Commiſſion, that he can hardly forbear murmuring, <hi>Muſt we bring water out of the Rock?</hi> Mark <note place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note> that word, <hi>muſt we?</hi> O how is the meekeſt man in all the world tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into paſſion, &amp; anger, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and hurried into ſad indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; &amp; yet there was not a man on earth whoſe prayers were ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and prevalent with God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his were. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 23. <hi>Exod-</hi> 32. 9,-15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c. So King <hi>Aſa</hi> was a man full of infirmitities and weakneſſes; he relyes on the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 7,—13.</note> on the Lord; he is very impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40722:192"/> and under a great rage upon the Seers reproof: He impriſons the Seer; he oppreſſed ſome of the people; or, as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>He cruſhed,</hi> or, <hi>he trampled upon ſome of the people at the ſame time:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly diſeaſed in his feet, he ſought to the Phyſitians, and not to the Lord; and yet this mans prayer was wonderful prevalent with God. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The Saints infirmities can never <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 15. Iſa. 30. 19. Ch. 65. 24.</note> make void thoſe gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which God ſtands engaged to hearken to the prayers of his people. Gods hearing of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth not depend upon ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but upon Chriſt's interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; not upon what we are in our ſelves, but upon what we are in the Lord Jeſus; both our perſons and our prayers, are acceptable in the beloved, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. When God hears our prayers, 'tis neither for our own ſakes, nor yet for our prayers ſake; but 'tis for his own ſake, and his ſons ſake, and his glory ſake, and his promiſe ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="274" facs="tcp:40722:193"/>
            <p> Certainly, God will never caſt off his people for their infirmities.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis the glory of a man to <note place="margin">Pro. 19. 11.</note> paſſe by infirmities: O how much more then muſt it be the glory of God to paſs by the infirmities of his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Saints are children: and what father will caſt off his children for their infirmities, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 13. 14. 1 Cor. 12. 27.</note> weakneſſes?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Saints are members of Chriſt's body: and what man will cut off a member becauſe of a ſcab or wart that is upon it? <hi>What man will cut off his Noſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther, becauſe there is ſome filth in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Saints are Chriſt's purchaſe, they are his poſſeſſion, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 22, 23. 1 Cor. 6. u't. Ch. 7. 23, 1 Pet. 13. 18, 19, 20.</note> his inheritance: Now what man is there that will caſt away, or caſt off his purchaſe, his poſſeſſion, his inheritance, becauſe of thorns, buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or bryars that grow upon it?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Saints are in a marriage <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2 19, 20.</note> covenant with God: Now what husband is there that will caſt off
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40722:193"/> his wife for her failings and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? So long as a man is in covenant with God, his infirmities can't cut him off from Gods mercy and grace. Now 'tis certain a man may have very many infirmities upon him, and yet not break his covenant with God; for no ſin breaks a mans covenant with God, but ſuch as unties the marriage knot. As in other marriages eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offence or infirmity doth not diſanul the marriage union; it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> only the breach of the marriage vow, <hi>viz.</hi> adultery, that untyes the marriage knot: So here, 'tis only thoſe ſins which breaks the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which unties the marriage knot between God and the Soul: 1. When men freely ſubject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny luſt as a new maſter. Or, 2. When men take another husband; <note place="margin">Iſa. 28, 15. 18.</note> and this men doe, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a league with ſin or the world; eh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                  <desc>…</desc>
               </gap> they make a new covenant with hell and deach. Now from theſe miſchiefs God ſecures his choſen ones. In a word, If
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40722:194"/> God ſhould caſt off his people for their infirmities, then none of the ſons or daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> could be ſaved: <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon the earth, that doth good and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not,</hi> Eccl. 7. 20. Now if God will not caſt off his people for their infirmities, then certainly he will not caſt off the prayers of his people, becauſe of thoſe invincible infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that hang upon them; and therefore our infirmities ſhould not diſcourage us, or take us off from Cloſet-prayer, or from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties of Religion. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, The more infirmities and weakneſſes hang upon us, the more cauſe have we to keep cloſe and conſtant to our Cloſet duties. If grace be weake, <note place="margin">The omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of good diet breeds dii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> the omiſſion of private prayer will make it weaker. Look as he that will not eat will certainly grow weaker and weaker: So he that will not pray in his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                  <desc>…</desc>
               </gap>et will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly grow weaker and weaker. If corruptions be ſtrong, the neglect of private prayer will make them
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40722:194"/> ſtronger. The more the remedy is neglected, the more the diſeaſe is ſtrengthned. Whatſoever the diſtempers of a mans heart be, they will never be abated, but augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the omiſſion of private prayer. The more bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities hang upon us the more need we have of the Phyſitian: and ſo the more ſinful infirmities hang upon our ſouls, the more need we have of private prayer. All ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful omiſſions will make work for repentance, for hell, or for the Phyſitian of ſouls. Sinful omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions lead to ſinful commiſſions; as you may ſee in the Angels that fell from heaven to hell, and in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> going to comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a martyr that was to be tormented, was himſelf apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Officers, and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to offer to the Idols, or to have his body abuſed by a Black amore that was ready for that purpoſe: of which hard choice, to ſave his life, he bowed
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40722:195"/> unto the Idol; but afterwards, making a ſad confeſſion of his foul fact, he ſaid, <hi>That he went forth that morning before he had been with God in his Cloſet;</hi> and ſo peremptorily concludes, <hi>that his neglect of Prayer was the cauſe of his falling into that great ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neglect of one day, of one duty, of one hour, would undoe us for ever, if we had not an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <note place="margin">1 John 2. 1, 2.</note> with the father. Thoſe years, thoſe months, thoſe weeks, thoſe days, thoſe hours that are not filled up with God, with Chriſt, with grace, with duty, will certainly be filled up with vanity and folly. All omiſſions of duty. will more and more unfit the ſoul for duty: A Key thrown by, gathers ruſt: A Pump not uſed, will be hardly got to go: And Armour not uſed, will be hardly made bright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Look as ſinful commiſſions will ſtab the Soul; ſo ſinful omiſſions will ſtarve the Soul. Such as live <note place="margin">Iſa. 24. 16. Job. 16. 8.</note> in the neglect of private prayer may well cry out, <hi>Our leanneſs, our</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:40722:195"/> 
               <hi>leanneſs.</hi> And therefore away with all theſe plea's and reaſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout infirmities, and weakneſſes, and indiſpoſitions, &amp; addreſs your ſelves to Cloſet-prayer. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I anſwer, It may be thy diſtemper and indiſpoſition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not ſo great, but that thou canſt buy, and ſell, and get gaine: Notwithſtanding thy aking head, <note place="margin">The body it ſelf, if you ſet too high a price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, will make a cheap Soul; and he is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man whoſe outſide is his beſt ſide.</note> and thy ſhooting back, and thy pained ſides, and thy feeble knees, yet thou canſt with <hi>Martha</hi> cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy ſelf about thy worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. In that <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. Chriſt calls upon his Spouſe, to open the door, and let him in: But ſin and ſhifting coming into the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſee how poorly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily ſhe labours to ſhift Chriſt off, <hi>I have put off my Coat; how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet; how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Rather than ſhe will make no excuſe for her ſelf, ſhe will make a ſilly excuſe, a worthleſs excuſe: She was paſt a child: and what a great buſineſſe had it been for her to have riſen to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40722:196"/> have let in ſuch a gueſt, that brings every thing with him, that heart <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17. 17.</note> can wiſh or need require: She was not grown ſo decrepid with old age, but that ſhe was able to make her ſelf ready; at leaſt, ſhe might eaſily have ſlipt on her morning Coat, and ſtept to the door with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of taking cold, or of being wet to the skin, and ſo <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 12.</note> have let him in, who never comes empty handed; yea, who was now come full of the dew of divine bleſſings to enrich her; for ſo ſome ſence thoſe words, <hi>Mine head is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi> O the frivolous pretences, and idle excuſes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gracious perſons are apt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to take up to over colour their neglect of duty!</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, It may be the Spouſe of Chriſt was aſeep: O no; for ſhe ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh:</hi> She ſlept with open eyes, as the Lyon doth; ſhe ſlept but half ſleep: though her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man was drowſie, yet her in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40722:196"/> ward man was wakeful; though the fleſh took a nap, yet her ſpirit did not nod.</p>
            <p>O, but it may-be Chriſt made no noiſe, he gave no notice that he was at the door: O yes, he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he knockt and bounced by the hammer of his word, and the hand of his Spirit; he knockt by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corrections and inward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; he knockt by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and he knockt by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: His importunity and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency for admiſſion was very great.</p>
            <p>O but it may-be he did but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knock, he ſhould have called as well as knockt; for none but mad-men would open their doors in the night, except they knew the voice of him that knocketh: O yes, he did not only knock, but cald alſo.</p>
            <p>O but it may-be ſhe did not know his voice, and therefore ſhe would not open. No chaſt wife will at unſeaſonable hours ariſe and open her doors unto a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40722:197"/> eſpecially in her husbands ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: O yes, ſhe knew his voice, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>It is the voice of my Beloved that knocketh:</hi> She was not ſo faſt aſleep, but that ſhe knew the voice of her Beloved from all other voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; could tell every tittle that he ſaid: The calls of Chriſt were ſo ſtrong, ſo loud, and his pulſations ſo mighty, that ſhe could not but know and confeſs, that it was the voice of her Beloved, though ſhe was not ſo reſpectful and dutiful as to obey that voice.</p>
            <p>O but it may-be Chriſt knockt and call'd, like a friend in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, only to enquire how it was with her, or to ſpeak to her at the Window: O no! he ſpeaks plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſpeaks with authority, <hi>Open to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but it may-be ſhe had no power to open the door: O yes; for when he commands his people to open, he <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6, 13. 1 Cor. 15. 10.</note> lends them a key to open the door, that he may enter in. Infuſed grace is a living principle that will enable the Soul to open to Chriſt.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40722:197"/> If a man be not a free agent to work and act by the helps of grace received, to what purpoſe are counſels, commands, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and directions, given to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, and that, and t'other work. And certainly, it is our greateſt honour and happineſſe in this world to co-operate with God in thoſe things which concern his own glory, and our own internal, and eternal good.</p>
            <p>O but it may-be Chriſt had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Spouſe ſome diſtaſt, or it may-be he had let fall ſome hard words, or ſome unkind ſpeeches, which made her a little froward and pettiſh: O no! for he owns her as his Beloved, and courts her highly, with the moſt winning and amicable tearms of love, <hi>My Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> or, <hi>my perfect one</hi> (he calls her ſo for her Dove like ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, purity, and integrity.) All theſe endearing and honouring Titles, are the Rhetorick of Divine love; and ſhould have been as ſo many
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40722:198"/> ſacred engagements upon her, to open to her Beloved.</p>
            <p>O but it may-be Chriſt was too quick for her, it may-be he gave but a knock and a call, and was gone before ſhe could riſe and open the door: O no! Chriſt ſtayed till <hi>his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night;</hi> which moſt paſſionate expreſſion, notes the tender goodneſs, patience and gentleneſſe of our Lord Jeſus, who endures far greater and harder things for his Spouſes ſake, than ever <hi>Jacob</hi> did for his <hi>Rachels</hi> ſake. After Chriſt had ſuffered much for her ſake, and waited her leaſure a long while, ſhe very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, and very unmannerly, and unworthily turns her back upon all his ſweet and comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, and bleſſed and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embracements, and turns him off to look his lodging in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; ſo that he might well have ſaid, Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friend, thy Husband, thy Lord, to ſuffer him to ſtand bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40722:198"/> and that in foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, in the night time, woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, intreating, and beſeeching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; and yet to turn him off as one in whom thy ſoul could take no pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now if you will but ſeriouſly weigh all theſe circumſtances in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, you may run and read, the fault, and folly, the weakneſs and madneſs, the ſlightneſs and lazineſs of the Spouſe; and by her you may make a judgement of thoſe ſad and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtempers that may ſeize upon the beſt of Saints, and ſee how ready the fleſh is to frame excuſes; and all to keep the ſoul off from duty, and the doors faſt bolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſad when men are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſit and chat, and trade in their ſhops; but are not well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pray in their cloſets. Certainly that mans heart is not right with God (at leaſt at this time), who under all his bodily diſtempers can maintain and keep
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40722:199"/> up his publick trade with men, but is not well enough to maintain his private trade with heaven. Our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are but dirt handſomly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, &amp; artificially formed; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our pedigree from the dirt, and are akin to clay. One calls the body, <hi>the blot of nature;</hi> another calls it, <hi>the Soul's beaſt, a ſack of dung, worms-meat;</hi> another calls it, <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a ſepulchre;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>a body of vileneſs.</hi> Now for a man to make ſo much adoe about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of his body, to excuſe the neglects of his Soul, is an evil made up of many evils. But real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir, I am ſo ill, and my body is ſo diſtempered and indiſpoſed, that I am not able to mind or meddle with the leaſt things of the world: Well, if this be ſo, then know that God hath on purpoſe knockt thee off from the things of this world, that thou may'ſt look the more effectually after the things of another world. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in all the diſtempers that are upon thy body, is to wind thee
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40722:199"/> more off from thy worldly trade, and to work thee to follow thine heavenly trade more cloſe. Many a man had never found the way to his Cloſet, if God by bodily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers had not turn'd him out of his ſhop, his trade, his buſineſs, his all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well Chriſtians, remember this once for all; if your indiſpoſition to Cloſet-prayer doth really ariſe from bodily diſtempers, then you may be confident that the Lord will pitty you much, and bear with you much, and kindly accept of a little: You know how affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Parents, and ingenious Maſters doe carry it towards their children and ſervants, when they are under bodyly diſtempers and indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and you may be confident that God will never carry it worſe towards you than they doe towards them. Ponder often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4, 16, 21, 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, I ſhall anſwer this Objection by way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus,</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:40722:200"/>
            <p> Firſt, There is a contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to private prayer, and there is an involuntary indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to private prayer: there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted indiſpoſition, and that is when a man by his wilful ſinning againſt light, knowledge, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contracts that guilt that lyes as a load upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Now guilt makes the Soul ſhye of God; and the greater the guilt is, the more ſhye the Soul is of drawing neer to God in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Child that is ſenſibly under guilt hides himſelf (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did) in the day from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7. 8.</note> eye, and at night he ſlips to bed, to avoid either a chiding, or a whipping from his Father. Guilt makes a man fly from God, and fly from Prayer: 'Tis a hard <note place="margin">Job 11. 14, 15. Jer. 20. 3, 4.</note> thing to look God in the face, when guilt ſtares a man in the face. Guilt makes a man a terrour to himſelf: now when a man is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to himſelf, he is neither fit to live, nor fit to die, nor fit to pray: When Poiſon gets into the body, it
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40722:200"/> works upon the ſpirits, and it weakens the ſpirits, and it endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers life, and unfits and indiſpoſes a man to all natural actions; 'tis ſo here, when guilt lyes heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience, it works upon the Soul, it weakens the Soul, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the Soul, and it doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully unfit and indiſpoſe the Soul to all holy actions. Guilt fights againſt our Souls, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> our Comforts, our Duties, yea, and our very graces alſo: There is nothing that wounds and lames our graces like guilt; there is nothing that weakens and waſts our graces like guilt; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hinders the activity of our graces like guilt; nor there is nothing that clouds our evidences of grace like guilt. Look what water is to the fire, that our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are to our graces, evidences, and duties. Guilt is like <hi>Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Vulture, that ever lyes gnawing. 'Tis better with <hi>Evagrius</hi> to lye on a Bed of ſtraw with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than to lye on a Bed of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40722:201"/> Downe with a guilty Conſcience. What the Probationer Diſciple ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt;</hi> that a guilty Conſcience ſaith to the ſinner, whitherſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou goeſt, I will follow thee: If thou goeſt to a faſt I will follow thee, and fill thy mind with black and diſmal apprehenſions of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou goeſt to a feaſt, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee, and ſhew thee <hi>the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the Wall:</hi> If thou goeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <note place="margin">Dan. 5 5.</note> I will follow thee, and make thee afraid of every Leaf that wags; thou ſhalt look upon every Buſh as an armed man, and upon every man as a Devil: If thou ſtayeſt at home, I will follow thee from room to room, and fill thee with horrour and terrour: If thou lyeſt down to reſt, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee with fearful dreams and tormenting apparitions: If thou goeſt into thy Cloſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will follow thee, and make thy very Cloſet a Hell to hold thee.</p>
            <p>It is ſtoried of King <hi>Richard</hi> the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40722:201"/> third, that after he had murthered his two Nephews in the Tower, guilt lay ſo hard upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that his ſleeps were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; for he would often leap out of his Bed in the dark, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword in his hand (which hung by his bed ſide) he would goe diſtractedly about his Chamber ſeeking for the Traytor.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth of <hi>France,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made the ſtreets of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> run down with the blood of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he could ſeldome take any ſound ſleep, nor could he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be awakened out of his ſleep without muſick.</p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Morgan</hi> that paſſed the Sentence of Condemnation upon <hi>Jane Grey</hi> (a virtuous Lady), ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after fell mad, and in his raving cryed out continualy, <hi>Take away the Lady Jane from me, Take away the Lady Jane from me,</hi> and in that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ended his wretched life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Abyes</hi> going to execution for Chriſt's ſake, as he went along he gave his money and his cloaths
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40722:202"/> to one and another, till he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all away to his ſhirt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of the Sheriffs men fell a-ſcoffing and deriding of him, and told him, that he was a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and an heretick, and not to be believed; but as ſoon as the good man was executed, this wretch was ſtruck mad, and threw away his cloaths, and cryed out, <hi>that James Abyes was a good man, and gone to Heaven, but he was a wicked man and was damned,</hi> and thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued crying out till his death: Certainly he that derides, or ſmites a man for walking according to the word of the Lord, the Lord will firſt or laſt ſoſmite and wound that mans Conſcience, that all the Phyſitians in the world ſhall not heal it.</p>
            <p>Now if thy indiſpoſition to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer ſprings from contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilt upon thy Conſcience, then thy beſt way is ſpeedily to renew thy Repentance, and greatly to judge and humble thine own ſoul, and ſo to act Faith afreſh upon the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40722:202"/> blood of Chriſt, both for pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, and for purging grace. When a man is ſtung with Guilt 'tis his higheſt wiſdome in the world to look up to the Brazen Serpent, and not to ſpend his time, or create torments to his own ſoul by perpetual poring upon his guilt: When Guilt upon the Conſcience works a man to water the earth with tears, &amp; to make Heaven ring with his groans, then it works kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: When the ſence of Guilt drives a man to God, to Duty, to the Throne of Grace, then it will not be long night with that man: He that thinks to ſhift off Private Prayer under the pretence of Guilt, doth but in that increaſe his own Guilt: Neglect of Duty will never get Guilt off the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But then there is an involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indiſpoſition to private prayer; as in a ſick man, who would work and walk, but cannot, being hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his diſeaſe; or as it is with a man that hath a great chain on his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40722:203"/> leg, he would very fain walk or get away, but his chain hinders him. Now if your indiſpoſition to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer be an involuntary indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, then God will in mercy, in courſe, both pardon it &amp; remove it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a total indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to private prayer, &amp; there is a partial indiſpoſition to private prayer. A total indiſpoſition to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer is, when a man hath no <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 22. Chap. 44. 17, 18, 19.</note> mind at all to private prayer, nor no will at all to private prayer, nor no love at all to private prayer, nor no delight, nor no heart at all to private prayer; now where this frame of heart is, there all is naught, very naught, ſtark naught. A partial indiſpoſition to private prayer is, when a man hath ſome will to private prayer, though not ſuch a will as once he had; and ſome mind to private prayer, though not ſuch a mind as once he had; and ſome affections to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, though not ſuch warm and burning affections as once he had. Now if your indiſpoſition
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40722:203"/> to private prayer be total, then you muſt wait upon the Lord in all his appointments, for a changed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for union with Chriſt; but if your indiſpoſition to private prayer be only partial, then the Lord will certainly pardon it, and in the very uſe of holy means in time remove it. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, there is a tranſient, accidental, occaſional, or fleeting indiſpoſition to private prayer; and there is a cuſtomary, a conſtant, or permanent indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to private prayer. Now a tranſient, accidental, occaſional, or fleeting indiſpoſition to that which is good, may be found upon the beſt of Saints, as you may ſee in <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. and in <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18. 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 9. and in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, chap.</hi> 1 and in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. 2, 3. Now if this be the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that thou art under, then thou mayeſt be confident, that it will certainly work off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <note place="margin">Iſa. 65. 2. Jer. 9. 3.</note> as theirs did that I have laſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40722:204"/> cited. But then there is a cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a conſtant or permanent indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to private prayer, and to all other holy Duties of Religion: Now if this be the indiſpoſition that thou art under, then I may ſafely conclude, that thou art in the very gall of bitterneſſe, and in <note place="margin">Acts 8. 21, 22, 23.</note> the bond of iniquity, and thy work lyes not in complaining of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, but in repenting and believing, and in labouring for a change of thy heart and ſtate; for till thy heart, thy ſtate, be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou wilt remain for ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, both to Cloſet-Prayer, and to all other Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and godlineſſe. To ſee a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſailing Hell-ward with Wind and Tide on his ſide to alter his courſe, and Tack about for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſee the earthly man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heavenly, the carnal man become ſpiritual, the proud man become humble, the vain man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerious; to ſee a ſinner move contrary to himſelf in the wayes of Chriſt and holineſs; is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40722:204"/> as ſtrange, as to ſee the earth fly upward, or the Bowl run contrary to its own Byaſs; and yet, a divine power of God upon the Soul can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, and this muſt be effected before the ſinner will be graciouſly inclined, and ſincerely diſpoſed to Cloſet-prayer. And let thus much ſuffice by way of Anſwer to this Objection alſo.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <p>Now for the better management of this great Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> Cloſet-prayer, I beſeech you take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counſel in theſe 11. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Be frequent in Cloſet-prayer, and not now and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He will never make any yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Cloſet-prayer, that is not frequent in Cloſet-prayer: Now that this Counſel may ſtick, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Other eminent Servants of the Lord have been frequent in this bleſſed work. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Let thine earnow be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayeſt hear the Prayer of thy Servant, which I pray before thee</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:40722:205"/> 
               <hi>day and night.</hi> So <hi>Daniel,</hi> he kneeled <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10</note> upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his God, as he did before time. So <hi>David, My voyce ſhalt thou hear in the morning, and in the evening will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 13. <hi>But unto thee have I cryed, O Lord, and in the morning ſhall my prayer prevent thee.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 147. <hi>I prevented the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 164.</note> 
               <hi>dawning of the morning, and cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. <hi>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray and cry aloud.</hi> Yea, he <note place="margin">Exod. 29 38, 39. Numb. 28. 3.

            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>(Carolus plus cum Deo quam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus loquitur)</hi> that he ſpake more with God than with men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the bleſſed Scripture doth not only enjoyn this Duty, but it requires frequency
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40722:205" rendition="simple:additions"/> in it alſo. <hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. In the former part of this diſcourſe, I have given light into theſe Scriptures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bare citing of them muſt now ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt was frequent in Private Prayer, as you may eaſily ſee by comparing of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together; <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 39. <hi>John.</hi> 18. 2. In my ſecond Argument for Private Prayer you may ſee theſe Scriptures opened and amplified. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider that you have the examples of the very worſt of men in this caſe. <hi>Papiſts</hi> are frequent in their private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> what occaſion ſoever they have, either by profit or pleaſure to divert them, will yet pray five times eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. Yea, the very <hi>Heathens</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to <hi>Hercules</hi> morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening upon the great Altar at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now ſhall blind nature do more than grace? But,</p>
            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:40722:206"/>
            <p> Fifthly, Conſider, you cannot have too frequent Communion with God, you cannot have too frequent intercourſe with Jeſus, you cannot have your hearts too frequently filled with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory, and with that peace that paſſes underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you cannot have heaven too frequently brought down into your hearts, nor you cannot have your hearts too frequently carried up to heaven, and therefore you cannot be too frequent in Cloſet-prayer. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider, that you are under frequent wants, and frequent ſins, and frequent ſnares, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8. Job. 1. 7.</note> temptations, and frequent allurements, and frequent tryals, and frequent cares, and frequent feares, and frequent favours; and therefore you had need be frequent with God in your Cloſets. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider, you are the favourites of heaven, you are greatly beloved, you are highly honoured, you are exceedingly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40722:206"/> eſteemed and valued in the Court of the Moſt High; and remember, that the Petitions of many weak Chriſtians, and of many benighted Chriſtians, and of many tempted Chriſtians, and of many clouded Chriſtians, and of many ſtaggering Chriſtians, and of many doubting Chriſtians, and of many bewildred Chriſtians, and of many fainting Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are put into your hands, for a quick and ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to the Throne of Grace; ſo that you had need be frequent in your Cloſets, and improve your intereſt in heaven, or elſe many of theſe poor hearts may be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, betrayed, and prejudiced by your neglect. Such as are Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in Princes Courts, if they are active, diligent, careful and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they may doe much good for others, they may come as often as they pleaſe into their Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and with Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> have <note place="margin">Eſth. 8.</note> for asking what they pleaſe, both for themſelves, and others, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7. O what a world of good may ſuch
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40722:207"/> doe for others that are Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, if they would be but frequent with God in their Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets!</p>
            <p>O Sirs, If you have not that love, that regard, that pitty, that compaſſion to your own ſouls, as you ſhould have; yet, O let not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuffer by your neglect of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer! O let not <hi>Zion</hi> ſuffer! O let not any particular Saint ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by your being found ſeldom in your Cloſets.</p>
            <p>Certainly, It might have gone better with the Churches of Chriſt, and with the concernments of Chriſt, and with many of the poor people of Chriſt, if moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had been more frequent with God in their Cloſets. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, Conſider, that this liberty to approach nigh <note place="margin">Sanguis Chriſti cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Coeli.</note> to God in your Cloſets, coſt Chriſt his deareſt blood, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. Now he that is not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with God in his Cloſet, tells all about him, that he ſets no great value upon that liberty, that Chriſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40722:207"/> hath purchaſed with his blood. The incomparable, the unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> price which Chriſt hath paid down upon the nail (above ſixteen hundred years agoe) that we might have liberty and free acceſs to his Father in your Cloſets, argues very ſtrongly, yea irrefragably, the ſuperlative excellency of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty! O therefore let us improve to purpoſe this bleſſed purchaſe of our Lord Jeſus by being frequent with God in our cloſets. 'Tis diſputed by ſome whether one drop of Chriſts blood was ſufficient for the pardon of our ſins and redemption of our ſouls. My intention is not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but to offer a few things to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It muſt be granted, that <note place="margin">One lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drop of Chriſt's blood is more worth than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </note> by reaſon of the hypoſtatical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a drop of Chriſt's blood was of an ineſtimable worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and the value of his paſſion is to be meaſured by the dignity of his perſon. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, a proportion was to be obſerved betwixt the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40722:208"/> due to men, and that which <note place="margin">What is the blood of the Grape, or the blood of a ſon, an only ſon, to the blood of a Saviour.</note> was ſuffered for man; that his ſufferings, might be ſatisfactory, two things were neceſſary, <hi>Poenae gravitas,</hi> as well as <hi>perſonae dignitas.</hi> That the leaſt drop of Chriſt's blood was not ſufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our ſouls may thus appear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If it were, then the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt was enough, for there was a drop, if not many drops of blood ſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Then his being Crown'd with a crown of Thorns, was ſufficient; for it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they drew blood-from him</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then all Chriſt's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings beſides were ſuperfluous and vain.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Then God was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unrighteous to take more than was due to his juſtice. But for any man to affirm that God hath taken beyond what was his juſt due, is high blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Then Chriſt was weak and imprudent to pay more
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40722:208"/> than he needed; for what need was there of his deareſt heart blood, if a drop from his hand would have ſaved our ſouls. Let School-men fancie what they pleaſe, 'tis certain, that not one dram of that bitter Cup that Chriſt drunk off could be abated, in order to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers full ſatisfaction, and mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal redemption. Chriſt hath given under his own hand that it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſuffer many things, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26. O Sirs, ſhall Chriſt ſhed not only a few drops of blood, but his very heart blood, to purchaſe you a freedom and liberty to be as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your Cloſets with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as you pleaſe; and will you only now and then give God a viſit in private? the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
            <p>My Second Adviſe and counſel is this, Take the fitteſt ſeaſons and opportunities that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can for Cloſet-prayer. Many take unfit ſeaſons for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, which do more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40722:209"/> the importunity of the ſoul in prayer, than all the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and inſtigations of Satan. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, When the body is drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie <note place="margin">Cant. 3. 1.</note> and ſleepy, this is a very unfit ſeaſon for cloſet-prayer. Take heed of laying cuſhions of ſloath under your knees, or pillows of idleneſſe under your elbows, or of mixing nods with your petitions, or of being drowſily devoted when you draw neer to God in your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When a mans head and heart is filled with worldly <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 35. Ezek. 33. 31.</note> cares and diſtractions, this is a very unfit ſeaſon for cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dinah</hi> muſt needs be gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad to ſee faſhions, <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> Prince of that country, meets with her, and forces her virginity. So when our hearts <hi>Dinah-like</hi> muſt needs be a roving and gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad after the things of the world, then Satan, the Prince of the air, uſually ſeizes upon us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40722:209"/> a rape upon our ſouls, and either leads us off from prayer, or elſe he doth ſo diſtract us in prayer, that it were better not to have prayed at all, than to have offered the ſacrifice of fooliſh and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted prayer.</p>
            <p>I have read a ſtory, how that one offered to give his horſe to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon condition he would but ſay the Lords Prayer, and think upon nothing but God; the proffer was accepted, and he began, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</hi> But I muſt have the bridle too (ſaid he) no, nor the Horſe neither (ſaid the other) for thou haſt loſt both already. The application is eaſie.</p>
            <p>Certainly, the moſt free and lively ſeaſons for Cloſet-prayer is the mornings, before a mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be blunted or cooled, deadned, damped, or flatted by worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes. A man ſhould ſpeak with God in his Cloſet, before he ſpeaks with his worldly affairs and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. A man ſhould ſay to all
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40722:210"/> his worldly buſineſſeg, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto his young men, when he went to offer up his only <hi>Iſaac, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide you here, and I will goe yonder and worſhip, and then return to you again.</hi> He that will attend Cloſet-prayer without diſtraction or diſturbance, muſt not, firſt, ſlip out of the world into his Cloſet, but he muſt firſt ſlip into his Cloſet before he be compaſſed about with a crowd of worldly employments.</p>
            <p>It was a Precept of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that when we enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip God, we muſt not ſo much as ſpeak or think of any worldly buſineſs, leaſt we make Gods ſervice an idle, perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and lazy recreation: The ſame I may ſay of Cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jerome</hi> complains very much of his diſtractions, dulneſs, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs to prayer, and chides himſelf thus, <hi>What doſt thou think, that Jonah prayed thus when he was in the Whales belly; or Daniel when he was among the Lyons; or the Thief when he was upon the Croſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="309" facs="tcp:40722:210"/>
            <p> Thirdly, When men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are under raſh and paſſionate <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> diſtempers; for when paſſions are up, holy affections are down; and this is a very unfit ſeaſon for Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-prayer; for ſuch prayers will never reach Gods eare, which do not firſt warm our own hearts. In the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Churches, if the Miniſter miſtake in reading, or ſtammer in pronouncing his words, or ſpeak any word that is not well heard, the hearers doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much blame him, and are ready to take the book from him, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to read therein: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is no leſs offended with the giddy, raſh, paſſionate, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and inconſiderate prayers of thoſe, who without a deliberate underſtanding do ſend their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to heaven in poſt-haſt. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> advice is worthy of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and acceptation, <hi>Be not</hi>

               <hi>ſo troubled or diſturbed, as to tumble over, and throw out words without wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or premeditation.</hi> Good men are apt many times to be too haſty, raſh, and unadviſed in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, complaints and deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 2. 2 Pſal. 116. 11 Job. 10. 1, 2, 3.

No Chriſtian to him that doth wiſely &amp; ſeriouſly weigh over his prayers and praiſes before he pours out his ſoul before the Lord. He never repents of his requeſts, who firſt duly deliberates what to requeſt; but he that blurts out whatſoever lyes uppermoſt, and that brings into the preſence of God his raſh, raw, tumultuary, and indigeſted petitions, confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, complaints, &amp;c. he doth but provoke God, he doth but brawl with God, inſtead of praying to him or wreſtling with him. Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Court obſerve their fitteſt times and ſeaſons of begging, they commonly take that very nick of time, when they have the King in a good mood, and ſo ſeldome or never come off but with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>

            <p> Sometimes God ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the heart to Cloſet-prayer, ſometimes he brings the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand into a praying frame, ſometimes both body and ſoul are more enlivened, quickned, raiſed, and divinely enflamed than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times; ſometimes Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is more ſtirring, working, and tender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O now ſtrike while the Iron is hot, O now lay hold on all ſuch bleſſed opportunities, by applying of thy ſelf to private prayer.

Muſt the beſt God be put off with the leaſt and worſt of your time? the Lord forbid.

            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:40722:212"/>
            <p> My Third Advice and counſel is this, Be marvelous care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that you do not perform Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Duties meerly to ſtill your Conſciences: you muſt perform them out of Conſcience, but you muſt not perform them only to quiet Conſcience. Some have ſuch a light ſet up in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings that they cannot omit <note place="margin">An ill Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (ſaith <hi>Auſtin)</hi> is like a ſcolding wife; a man (ſaith he) that hath an ill Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he cares not to be at at home, he cares not to look into his own ſoul, but loves to be abroad.</note> Cloſet-prayer, but Conſcience is upon their backs, Conſcience is ſtill upbraiding and diſquieting of them, and therefore they are afraid to neglect Cloſet-prayer, leaſt Conſcience ſhould queſtion, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and condemn them for their neglects. Sometimes when men have greatly ſinned againſt the Lord, Conſcience becomes impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and is ſtill accuſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and terrifying of them; and now in theſe Agonies they will run to their Cloſets, and cry, and pray, and mourn, and confeſs, and bitterly bewail their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but all this is only to quiet their Conſciences; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40722:212"/> they find upon their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Cloſet-duties, that their Conſciences are a little allayed and quieted; and for this very end and purpoſe do they take up Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-prayer, as a charm to allay their Conſciences; and when the ſtorm is over, and their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quieted, then they lay aſide Cloſet-prayer, (as the <hi>Monk</hi> did the net when the fiſh was caught) and are ready to tranſgreſſe again. O Sirs, take heed of this, for this is but plain hypocriſie, and will be bitterneſſe in the end. He that performs Cloſet-prayer only to bribe his Conſcience that it may not be clamorous, or to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience that it may not accuſe him for ſin, he will at length venture upon ſuch a trade, ſuch a courſe of ſinning againſt Conſcience, as will certainly turn his troubled Conſcience into a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience: And a ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is like a ſleepy Lyon, when <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2.</note> he awakes he roars and tears his prey in pieces: and ſo will a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40722:213"/> Conſcience, when 'tis awakened, roar and tear the ſecure ſinner in pieces.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Conſcience was awakened, he was ſo troubled with fear and horrour of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that not daring to truſt his beſt friends with a razor, he uſed to ſinge his beard with burning coals, as <hi>Cicero</hi> reports. All the mercy that a ſeared, a benummed Conſcience, doth afford the ſinner, when it doth moſt befriend him, when it deals moſt ſeemingly kind with him, is this, that it will not cut, that it may kill; it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that it may confound; it will not accuſe, that it may condemn; it will ſpare the ſinner a while, that it may torment him for ever; it will ſpare him here, that it may gnaw him hereafter; it will not ſtrike, till it be too late for the ſinner to ward off the blow. O cruel mercy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſin, and let alone the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till the gates of mercy be ſhut upon him, and hell ſtands gaping to devour him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Sin lyeth at</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:40722:213"/> 
               <hi>the door.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Robets</hi> ſignifies <hi>to lye down, or couch,</hi> like ſome wild beaſt at the mouth of his cave, as if he were aſleep, but indeed watcheth and waketh, and is ready <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amama</hi> quotes <hi>Tarnovius,</hi> who mentions a ſort of men, that brought in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he calls a new-Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that if a man perform the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> if he go to the Church, hear the word, pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſalvation.</note> to fly at all that come neer it. O Sirs, ſin is rather couchant than dormant, it ſleeps dogs ſleep, that it may take the ſinner at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage, and fly the more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in his face. But,</p>
            <p>My Fourth Advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is this, Take heed of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Cloſet-duties; take heed of truſting in Cloſet-duties. <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove made uſe of her wings, but ſhe did not truſt in her wings, but in the Arke: So you muſt make uſe of Cloſet-duties, but you muſt not truſt in your Cloſet-duties, but in Jeſus, of whom the Ark was but a Type. There are many that go a round of duties, (as mill-horſes go their round in a mill) and reſt upon them when they have done, uſing the means as mediators, and ſo fall ſhort of Chriſt and heaven at once. Cloſet-duties reſted in,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40722:214"/> will as eternally undo a man, as the greateſt and fouleſt enormities; open wickedneſs ſlayes her thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but a ſecret reſting upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſlayes her ten thouſands: Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes bleed inwardly of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, &amp; die for ever. Open prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the broad dirty way that leads to hell, but Cloſet-duties reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in is a ſure way, though a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way to hell. Prophane perſons and formal profeſſors ſhall meet at laſt in one hell. Ah Chriſtians, do not make Cloſet-duties your money, leaſt you and your money periſh together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phenix</hi> gathers ſweet odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous ſticks in <hi>Arabia</hi> together, and then blows them with her wings, and burns her ſelf with them; ſo doe many ſhining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors burn themſelves by reſting in their duties and ſervices. You know in <hi>Noah's</hi> flood all that were not in the Ark, though they climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the talleſt Trees, and the higheſt mountains and hills, yet were really drowned; ſo let men
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40722:214"/> climb up to this duty and that, yet if they don't get into Chriſt, they will be really damned. 'Tis not thy Cloſet, but thy Chriſt that muſt ſave thee. If a man be not intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, he may periſh with <hi>Our Father</hi> in his mouth. 'Tis as natural to a man to reſt in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as 'tis for him to reſt in his bed.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Bernards</hi> temptation, who being a little aſſiſted in duty, could ſtroak his own head with <hi>bene feciſti Bernarde, O Bernard this was gallantly done, now cheer up thy ſelf.</hi> Ah how apt is man, when he hath been a little aſſiſted, heated, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, enlarged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to goe away and ſtroak himſelf, <note place="margin">Iſa. 50, ult.</note> and bleſſe himſelf, and hug him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and warm himſelf with the ſparks, with the fire of his own kindling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was to win life and wear <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2.</note> it, he was to be ſaved by his doings, <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> Hence it is that <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37. Chap. 16. 30.</note> all his poſterity are ſo prone to ſeek for ſalvation by doing; <hi>What</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:40722:215"/> 
               <hi>ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> and <hi>good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 10. 17, 20.</note> 
               <hi>what ſhall I doe that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Like Father, like Son. But if our own duties or doings were ſufficient to ſave us, to what purpoſe did Chriſt leave his Fathers boſome, and lay down his deareſt life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cloſet-duties reſted in may pacifie Conſcience for a time; but this will not alwayes hold: <hi>When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſs, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Judah ſaw his wound, then went Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to King Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb; yet could they not heal him, nor cure him of his wound.</hi> If we reſt on Cloſet-duties, or on any thing elſe on this ſide Chriſt, we ſhall find them as weak as the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or as <hi>Jareb;</hi> we ſhall find to our coſt, that they can't help us nor heal us; they can't comfort us, nor cure us of our wounds. As creatures, ſo duties, were never true to any that have truſted in them. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in great <note place="margin">Judg. 10. 14.</note> diſtreſſe, the Lord bids them go and cry unto the gods which they had choſen, and let them deliver you
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40722:215"/> (ſaith God) in the time of your tribulation. O Sirs, if when you are under diſtreſſe of Conſcience, or lying upon a dying Bed, God ſhould ſay to you, go to your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-prayers and performances, that you have made and reſted in; go to your Cloſet-tears that you have ſhed and reſted in, and let them ſave you and deliver you; Oh what miſerable ſaviours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters would they be unto you? Look what the Ark of God was to the <hi>Phyliſtins,</hi> that Cloſet-duties <note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.</note> are to Satan; he trembles every time he ſees a poor ſinner go into his Cloſet, and come out of his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet reſting and glorying in Jeſus, and not in his duties; but when he ſees a poor creature confide in his Cloſet-duties, and reſt upon his Cloſet-duties, then he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, then he claps his hands and ſings ahah ſo would I have it. Oreſt not on any thing on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt; ſay to your graces, ſay to your duties, ſay to your holineſs, you are not my Saviour, you are
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40722:216"/> not my Mediator; and therefore you are not to be truſted to, you are not to be reſted in. 'Tis my duty to perform Cloſet-duties, but 'tis my ſin to rely upon them, or to put confidence in them; do them I muſt, but glory in them I muſt not. He that reſts in his Cloſet-duties, he makes a ſaviour of his Cloſet-duties. Let all your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-duties lead you to Jeſus, and leave you more in communion <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> with him, and in dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and then thrice happy will you be. Let all thy Cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and tears, thy Cloſet-faſtings and meltings, be a Star to guide thee to Jeſus, a <hi>Jacobs</hi> I adder by which thou mayeſt aſcend into the boſome of Eternal Loves, and then thou art ſafe for ever.</p>
            <p>Ah 'tis ſad to think, how moſt men have forgotten their reſting place, as the Lord complains, <hi>My</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 50. 6.</note> 
               <hi>people have been like loſt ſheep, their Shepheards have cauſed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and have turned them away to the Mountains; they have gone from moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:40722:216"/> 
               <hi>to hill, and forgotten their reſting place.</hi> Ah how many poor ſouls are there, that wander from moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to hill, from one duty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and here they will reſt, and there they will reſt, and all on this ſide their reſting place! O Sirs, 'tis God himſelf that is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting place, 'tis his free grace, 'tis his ſingular mercy, 'tis his infinite love that is your reſting place; 'tis the boſome of Chriſt, the favour of Chriſt, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and the pure, perfect, ſpotleſſe, marchleſs, and glorious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, that is your reſting place; and therefore ſay to all your Cloſet-duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, farewell; prayer farewell, reading farewell, faſting farewell, tears farewell, ſighs and groanes farewell, meltings and humblings I will never truſt more to you, I will never reſt more on you; but I will now return to my reſting place, I will now reſt only in God and Chriſt, I will now reſt wholly in God and Chriſt, I will
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40722:217"/> now reſt for ever in God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It was the ſaying of a precious Saint, <hi>that he was more afraid of his duties than of his ſins; for the one made him often proud, the other made him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways humble.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>My fifth advice and counſel is this, Labour to bring your hearts into all your Cloſet-prayers and performances: Look that your tongues and your hearts keep time &amp; tune. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips;</hi> or, as it is in the Hebrew, <hi>without lips of deceit.</hi> Heart and tongue muſt goe together; word and work, lip and life, prayer and practiſe, muſt eccho one to another, or elſe thy prayers and thy ſoul will be loſt together; the labour of the lips, and the travail of the heart muſt go together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> of all fruits made choice of the Peach to conſecrate <note place="margin">Plutark.</note> to their Goddeſs, and for no other cauſe, but that the fruit thereof is like to ones heart, and the leaf like
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40722:217"/> to ones tongue. Theſe very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in the worſhip of their gods thought it neceſſary that mens hearts and tongues ſhould go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ah Chriſtians, when in your Cloſet-duties your hearts and your tongues go together, then you make that ſweet and delightful melody, that is moſt taking and pleaſing to the King of Kings. The very ſoul of prayer lyes in the <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 15.</note> pouring out of the Soul before God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 4. <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out my ſoul in me.</hi> So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> poured out their ſouls like water before the Lord: So the Church, <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. VVith my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early,</hi> Iſa. 26. 8, 9. So <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 41. <hi>Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>For God is my witneſſe whom I ſerve in the Spirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 15. <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, and ſing</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:40722:218"/> 
               <hi>with the ſpirit. Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>VVe are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the ſpirit.</hi> Under the Law the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts were only to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God in ſacrifice; the skin belonged to the Prieſts; whence we may eaſily gather, that truth in the inward parts, is that which is moſt pleaſing in a ſacrifice. When the <hi>Athenians</hi> would know of the Oracle the cauſe of their often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous ſucceſſes in battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſeeing they offered the choyceſt things they could get, in ſacrifice to the gods, which their enemies did not, the Oracle gave them this anſwer, <hi>that the gods were better pleaſed with their inward ſupplication without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than with all their outward pomp in coſtly Sacrifices.</hi> Ah Sirs, the reaſon why ſo many are ſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in their Cloſet-duties and ſervices is, becauſe there is no more of their hearts in them. No man can make ſure work, or happy work in prayer, but he that makes heart work on it. When a mans
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40722:218"/> heart is in his prayers, then great and ſweet will be his returns from heaven; that is no prayer in which the heart of the perſon bears no part. When the Soul is ſeparated from the body the man is dead; and ſo when the heart is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the lip in prayer, the prayer is dead.</p>
            <p>The Jews at this day write upon the walls of their Synagogues theſe words, <hi>Tephillah belo cavannah ceguph belo neſhamah;</hi> that is, <hi>a prayer without the heart</hi> (or, <hi>without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the affection) is like a body without a ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prieſt was commanded to waſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and the feet of the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in water, <hi>and this was done,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philo, not without a myſtery, to teach us to keep our hearts and affections clean when we draw nigh to God.</hi> In all your Cloſet-duties God looks firſt and moſt to your hearts, <hi>My Son</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 26.</note> 
               <hi>give me thy heart.</hi> It is not a piece, it is not a corner of the heart, that will ſatisfie the maker of the heart; the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40722:219"/> heart is a treaſure, a bed of ſpices, a royal throne wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. God looks not at the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of your prayers, to ſee how neat they are; nor yet at the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of your prayers, to ſee how long they are; nor yet at the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick of your prayers, to ſee how many they are; nor yet at the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of your prayers, nor yet at the ſweetneſs of your voice, nor yet at the Logick of your prayers; but at the ſincerity of your prayers, how hearty they are. There is no prayer acknowledged, approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, accepted, recorded, or reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, but that wherein the heart is ſincerely and wholly. The true mother would not have the <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 17. James 1. 8.</note> child divided. As God loves a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and a contrite heart, ſo he loaths a divided heart. God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves halting nor halving, he will be ſerved truly and totally. The Royal Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love and ſerve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, when the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40722:219"/> beaſts were cut up for ſacrifice, the firſt thing the Prieſt looked upon <note place="margin">Pro. 21. 27. Iſa. 1. 11, 12. Chap. 29. 13. Mat. 15. 7, 8, 9. Ezek. 33. 30, 31, 32. Zech. 7. 4, 5, 6. 2 Chron. 25 1, 2. Pſal. 78. 36, 37.</note> was the heart, and if the heart was naught, the ſacrifice was rejected. Verily, God rejects all thoſe ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſacrifices, wherein the heart is not, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the margent together. Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart is but as ſounding braſs or a tinckling Cymbal. Prayer is only lovely and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the heart is in it, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. It is not the lifting up of the voyce, nor the wringing of the hands, nor the beating of the breaſts, nor an affected tone, nor ſtudied notions, nor ſeraphical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but the ſtirrings of the heart, that God looks at in prayer. God hears no more than the heart ſpeaks: if the heart be dumb. God will certainly be deaf; no prayer takes with God, but that which is the travel of the heart.</p>
            <p>The ſame day <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> came to the imperial dignity, ſitting in his Golden Chair, he offered a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40722:220"/> beaſt in Sacrifice to the gods; but when the beaſt was opened, it was without a heart, which the South-ſayers looked upon as an ill omen. 'Tis a ſad omen, that thou wilt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke the Lord than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him, who art habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally heartleſſe in thy Cloſet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

            </p>
            <p>It was the ſpeech of bleſſed <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that he would never leave a Duty, till he had brought his heart into the frame of the duty; he would not leave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin, till his heart was broken for ſin; he would not leave petitioning for grace, till his heart was quickened and enlivened, in a hopeful expectation of more grace; he would not leave gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, till his heart was enlarged with the ſence of the mercies he enjoyed, and quickened in the return of praiſe.</hi>

            <p>My ſixth advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is this, Be fervent, be warm, be importunate with God in all your Cloſet-duties and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40722:226"/> times and ſeaſons; and <hi>praying with perſeverance,</hi> is oppoſed to a fainting in our ſpirits, in reſpect of this or that particular ſuit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that we put up to God. When God turns a deaf ear to our prayers, we muſt not fret nor faint, we muſt not be diſmayed nor diſcouraged; but we muſt hold up and hold on in the Duty of prayer with invincible patience, courage, and conſtancy, as the Church did, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 8, 44, 55, 56, 57. compared. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Continue in prayer, and watch in the ſame with thanksgiving.</hi> We muſt be conſtant and inſtant in Cloſet-prayer; we muſt wait upon it, and lay all aſide for it. He that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Cloſet by fits and ſtarts, will neither glorifie God, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage his own ſoul. If we do not make a trade of Cloſet-prayer, we ſhall never make any yearnings of Cloſet-prayer. Look as they that get money by their Iron Mills, do keep a continual fire in their Iron Mills; ſo they that will
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40722:227"/> get any ſoul-good by Cloſet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they muſt keep cloſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to Cloſet-duties.

            <p> Firſt, When his heart is alwayes in a praying frame. Look as a man may be truly ſaid to give alwayes, whoſe heart is alwayes in a giving frame; and to ſuffer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, whoſe heart is alwayes in a ſuffering frame. <hi>For thy ſake are</hi>

            <p>Secondly, A man prayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, when he takes hold on every fit ſeaſon and opportunity for the pouring out of his ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in his Cloſet. To pray alwayes is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to pray in every opportunity; but of this before.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved by ſome, of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that he was wont to give cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain oracles, but it was hard to make him ſpeak and deliver them, but he would turn himſelf into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhapes and forms; yet if they would hold out, &amp; preſs him hard
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40722:229"/> without fear, into whatſoever form or ſhape he appeared, they were ſure to have ſatisfactory Oracles: So if we continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in our Cloſet-wreſtlings with God, if we hold on in private prayer, though God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us in the form or ſhape of a Judge, an enemy, a ſtranger, we ſhall certainly ſpeed at laſt. <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto</hi>

To continue in giving glory to God in this way of duty, is as neceſſary
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40722:229"/> and requiſite, as to begin to give glory to God in this way of duty; for though the beginning be more than half, yet the end is more than all. The God of all perfections looks that our <hi>

            <p> When ever you go into your Cloſets, preſs hard after real and ſenſible Communion with God, that ſo you may come out of your Cloſets with ſome ſhines of God upon your ſpirits; as <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount with his <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 29, 35.</note> face ſhining. O do not take up in your Cloſet-prayers, or tears, or joyes, or enlargements; but labour and long to enjoy that inward and cloſe Fellowſhip with God in your Cloſets, as may leave ſuch a choice, and ſweet favour of God, both upon your hearts and lives, as others may be forced to ſay, ſurely <note place="margin">Acts 4. 13.</note> theſe have been with Jeſus.

            <p>O Sirs, Cloſet-prayer will be found to be but a dry, ſapleſſe, live-leſſe, heartleſſe, comfortleſſe, thing, if you do not enjoy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in it. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40722:231"/> with God is the very Life, Soul, and Crown of all your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-duties; and therefore preſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it as for Life: When you go into your Cloſets let every thing go, that may hinder your fruition of Chriſt, and let every thing be embraced, that makes way for your enjoyment of Chriſt. O let Cloſet-prayer be a golden bridge, a wherry, a Chariot to convey your Souls over to God, and to bring you into a more intimate Communion with God. Let no Cloſet-duty ſatisfie you or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you, wherein you have not converſed with God, as a Child converſeth with his Father, or as a wife converſeth with her Husband, or as a Friend converſeth with his Friend, even face to face. Nothing ſpeaks out more unſoundneſs, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and baſeneſs of heart, than this, when men make Duty, the end of Duty; Prayer, the end of Prayer; than when men can begin a Duty, and go on in a Duty, and cloſe up a Duty, and bleſs and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40722:232"/> ſtroake themſelves after a Duty, and yet never enjoy the leaſt Communion with God in the Duty.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
               </label> with God in ſorrow and tears, when he hath not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in joy delight; a <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 17.</note> man may have Communion with God in a heart-humbling, a heart-melting, and a heart-abaſing way, when he hath not Communion with God in a heart reviving, a heart-cheering, and a heart-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting way. 'Tis a very great miſtake among many tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Chriſtians, to think that they have no Communion with God in their Cloſets, except they meet with God embracing and kiſſing, <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 4, 5, 6.</note> cheering and comforting up of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40722:232"/> their ſouls; when they find God raiſing the ſprings of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their ſouls, when they find God a ſpeaking peace unto them, when they find the ſingular ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8.</note> preſence of God cheering, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, and enlarging of them in their Cloſets, O then they are willing to grant that they have had ſweet Communion with God in their Cloſets; But if God meets with them in their Cloſets, and only breaks their hearts for ſin, and from ſin, if he meets with them and only makes his power and his preſence manifeſt, in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and caſting down of their ſouls, upon the ſight and ſence of their ſtrong corruptions and many imperfections, how unwilling are are they to believe that they have had any Communion with God. Well Friends, remember this once for all, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Chriſtian may have as real Communion with God in a heart-humbling way, as he can have in a heart-comforting way; a Chriſtian may have as
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40722:233"/> choice Communion with God <note place="margin">John 20. 11,—19.</note> when his eyes are full of tears, as he can have when his heart is full of joy. Sometimes God meets with a poor Chriſtian in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and exceedingly breaks him and humbles him, and at other times he meets with the ſame Chriſtian in his Cloſet, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily cheers him and comforts him; ſometimes God meets with a poor Soul in his Cloſet, and there he ſweetly quiets him and ſtills him, and at other times he meets with the ſame Soul in his Cloſet, and then he greatly revives him and quickens him: God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes come upon the Soul one way, he doth not alwayes come in at one, and the ſame door. We <note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> ſometimes look for a Friend to come in at the fore-door, and then he comes in at the back-door; and at other times, when we look for him at the back door, then he comes in at the fore-door; and juſt ſo 'tis with Gods coming into his peoples ſouls: Sometimes
<pb facs="tcp:40722:233"/> they go into their Cloſets, and look that God will come in at the fore-door of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and then God comes in at the back-door of ſorrow and grief; and at other times, when they look that God ſhould come in at the back-door of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, breaking, and melting their hearts, then God comes in at the fore-door of joy and conſolation, cheering and rejoycing their ſouls. But.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That all Chriſtians do not enjoy a like Communion with God in their Cloſets; ſome enjoy much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in their Cloſets, and others enjoy but little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in their Cloſets. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a more cleer, glorious, <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 11. Deut. 5. 4. Num. 12. 7, 8.</note> and conſtant Communion with God in his dayes, than any others had in thoſe times wherein he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God ſpake to none <hi>face to face,</hi> as he did to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> in his time had a more cloſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> friendly, and intimate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:40722:234"/> with God, than holy <hi>Lot</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others had in that day. And though all the Diſciples <hi>(Judas</hi> excepted) had ſweet Communion with Chriſt in the days of his fleſh, <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> yet <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had a more cleer, choice, and full Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, than the reſt had: Among all the Diſciples <hi>John</hi> had <note place="margin">John 13. 23 John 20. 2. and Chap. 21. 20.</note> moſt boſome Communion with Chriſt, he was the greateſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in Chriſt's Court, he leaned on Chriſt's boſome, he could ſay any thing to Chriſt, and he could know any thing of Chriſt, and he could have any thing of Chriſt; now that all Chriſtians do not enjoy Communion with God alike in their Cloſets may be thus made evident.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All Chriſtians do not prepare alike to enjoy Cloſet-Communion with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Chriſtians do not enjoy Communion with God alike in <note place="margin">Eccl. 5. 1. Pſal. 10. 17.</note> their Cloſets: Commonly he that prepares and fits himſelf moſt for Cloſet-Communion with God, he
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40722:234"/> is the man that enjoyes moſt Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Communion <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All Chriſtians do not alike prize Communion with God in their Cloſets; ſome prize Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in their cloſets, before all, &amp; above all other things: As that noble Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <hi>be he that prefers all the world to one hours Communion with God:</hi> They look upon it as that pearl of price, for the enjoyment of which, they are ready to ſell all, and part with all; others prize it at a lower rate, and ſo enjoy leſs of it, than thoſe that ſet a higher price and value upon it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; All Chriſtians do not a-like preſs after Communion with God in their Cloſets; ſome preſs after Communion with God in their Cloſets, as a condemned man preſſes after a pardon, or as a cloſe priſoner preſſes after enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or as a poor beggar preſſes after an almes; now, you know <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 8. Iſa. 26. 8, 9.</note> theſe preſs on with the greateſt earneſtneſs, the greateſt fervency,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40722:235"/> and the greateſt importunity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable: But others preſs after Communion with God in their Cloſets more coldly, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, more ſlightly, more lazily. <hi>I have put off my Coat, how ſhall I put</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them</hi>

               </gap>ow they that preſs hardeſt after Communion with God in their Cloſets, they are uſually bleſt with the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Cloſet-Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All Chriſtians don't a-like improve their Communion with God in their Cloſets; and therefore all Chriſtians don't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with God a-like in their Cloſets. Some Chriſtians do make a more wiſe, a more humble, a more holy, a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a more fruitful, and a more conſtant improvement of their Cloſet-Communion with God than others do, and therefore they are bleſt with higher degrees of Communion with God than others are: Some Chriſtians do
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40722:235"/> more improve their Cloſet-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God againſt the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, than others doe; and therefore no wonder if they do enjoy more Communion with God in their Cloſets than others do.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, All Chriſtians do not a-like need Communion with God in their Cloſets; and therefore all Chriſtians have not a-like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in their Cloſets. All Chriſtians have not alike place in the myſtical body of Chriſt, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 14,—<hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> ſome rule, and others are ruled; now every man ſtands in more or leſs need of Communion with God, according to the place that he bears in the body of Chriſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, all Chriſtians have not a-like burdens to bear, nor a-like difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to encounter with, nor a like dangers to eſcape, nor a-like temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to wreſtle with, nor a-like paſſions and corruptions to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, nor a-like mercies and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to improve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Chriſtians don't need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40722:236"/> Communion with God in their Cloſets: Now commonly God lets himſelf out more or leſſe in wayes of Communion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the various neceſſities and conditions of his people doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, All Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not a-like meet with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward interruptions, nor inward interruptions; and therefore all Chriſtians have not a-like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in their Cloſets. Some Chriſtians meet with a world of outward and inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions more than others doe; ſome Chriſtians outward Callings, Relations, Conditions, and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do afford more plentiful matter and occaſions, to interrupt them in their Cloſet-Communion with God, than other Chriſtians Callings, Relations, Conditions, and Stations doe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides Satan is more buſie with ſome Chriſtians, than he is with other Chriſtians; and corruptions work more ſtrongly and violently in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40722:236"/> ſome Chriſtians, than they do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let me add this to all the reſt, that the very natural tempers of ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are more averſe to cloſet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than the natural tempers of other Chriſtians are; and therefore all Chriſtians have not a-like Communion with God in their Cloſets, but ſome have more and ſome have leſs, according as God in his infinite Wiſdome ſees beſt.</p>
            <p>Now let no Chriſtian ſay, that he hath no Communion with God in Cloſet-prayer, becauſe he hath not ſuch a full, ſuch a choice, ſuch a ſweet, ſuch a ſenſible, and ſuch a conſtant Communion with God in Cloſet-prayer, as ſuch and ſuch Saints have had, or as ſuch and ſuch Saints now have; for all Saints do not alike enjoy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in their Cloſets, ſome have more, ſome have leſs; ſome have a higher degree, others a lower; ſome are wrapt up in the third heaven, when others are but wrapt up in the clouds: What man
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40722:237"/> is there ſo childeſt and babiſh as to argue thus, That he hath no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe he hath not the wiſdome of <hi>Solomon;</hi> or, that he hath no ſtrength, becauſe he hath not the ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon;</hi> or, that he hath no life, becauſe he hath not the ſwiftneſs of <hi>Ahimaaz;</hi> or, that he hath no eſtate, becauſe he hath not the riches of <hi>Dives:</hi> and yet ſo childiſh and babiſh many weak Chriſtians are, as to argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that they have no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in their Cloſets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not ſuch high, ſuch comfortable, and ſuch conſtant Communion with God in their Cloſets, as ſuch and ſuch Saints have had, or as ſuch and ſuch Saints now have; whereas they ſhould ſeriouſly conſider, that though ſome Saints have a great Communion with God, yet other Saints have but a ſmall Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; and though ſome Chriſtians have a ſtrong Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, yet other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have but a weak Communion
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40722:237"/> with God; and though ſome of the people of God have a very cloſe and neer Communion with God, yet others of the people of God have but a more remote Communion with God; and though ſome of Gods ſervants have a daily, conſtant, and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Communion with God, yet others of his ſervants have but a more tranſient and inconſtant Communion with God. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, When a man acts grace in Cloſet-duties, then certainly he hath Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in Cloſet-duties; <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 17. 1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> when a man in Cloſet-duties acts faith on God, or faith on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or faith on the blood of Chriſt, or when a man in private duties acts repentance for ſin, or love to Jeſus Chriſt, or ſets up God as the object of his fear, or as the object of his joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then he hath Communion with God, then he hath fellowſhip with the Father, <note place="margin">1 John 1. 3.</note> and with the Son. An unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man may act gifts and parts
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40722:238"/> in a duty, but he cannot act grace in a duty; for no man can act grace in a duty, but he that hath grace in his ſoul: And hence it comes to paſſe that unſanctified <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 11, 12, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> perſons under the higheſt activity of their arts, parts, and gifts in religious duties, enjoy no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God at all, witneſs the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes, Demas, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c. As ever you would have an evidence of your Communion with God in Cloſet-duties, carefully look to the activity of your graces, carefully <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6.</note> ſtir up the grace of God which is in you. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, When a man hath Communion with God in his Cloſet, then he gives God the glory of all his actings and <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 1.</note> activities. Communion with God alwayes helps a man to ſet the Crown of praiſe and honour upon the head of God, witneſſe that gracious and grateful Doxology of <hi>David</hi> and his people in that 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>Now therefore our God, we</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:40722:238"/> 
               <hi>thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious name.</hi> Men that enjoy no Communion with God in Religious Duties, are ſtill a ſacrificing unto their own Net, and a burning incenſe unto <note place="margin">Hab. 1. 16.</note> their own Drag; they are ſtill a bleſſing themſelves, and a ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves, and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Luke 17. 11. 12.</note> themſelves, they think the Garland of praiſe, the Crown of honour becomes no head but their own; but now, men that enjoy Communion with God in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties, they will uncrown themſelves to crown God, they will uncrown their duties, to Crown the God of their duties, they will <note place="margin">Acts 3 11, 12, 13, 16. Rev. 4. 10. 11. Chap. 5. 11, 12.</note> uncrown their arts, parts, gifts and inlargments, to ſet the Crown of praiſe upon the head of God alone. Thou thinkeſt that thou haſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Cloſet-duties, yea, thou ſayeſt that thou haſt Communion with God in Cloſet-duties, but on whoſe head doſt thou put the garland of praiſe? if on <note place="margin">Pſal. 148. 13.</note> Gods head, thou haſt Communion with God; if on thine own head,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40722:239"/> thou haſt no Communion with God. As all the Rivers run into the ſea, &amp; all the lines meet in the Center; ſo when all our Cloſet-duties terminate and center in the advance of Gods glory, then have we communion with God in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did uſe to write the Name of Chriſt over his door. When a man hath Communion with Chriſt in a duty, then he will write the Name of Chriſt, the Honour of Chriſt upon his duty. Some ſay, that the Name of Jeſus was engraven upon the heart of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius;</hi> ſure I am, when a man hath Communion with God in a Duty, then you ſhall find the Honour and Glory of Jeſus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon that Duty. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I anſwer, When the performance of Cloſet-duties leaves the ſoul in a better frame, then a man hath Communion with God in them: When a man comes off from Cloſet-duties in a more holy frame, or in a more humble frame, or in a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40722:239"/> frame, or in a more watchful frame, or in a more heavenly frame, or in a more broken frame, or in a more quickened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened frame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then certainly he hath had Communion with God in thoſe Duties. When a man comes out of his Cloſet, and finds the frame of his heart to be more ſtrongly ſet againſt ſin than ever, and to be more highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to walk with God than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to be more eminently crucified to the world than ever, and to be more divinely fix't againſt temptations than ever, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peradventure he hath had communion with God in his cloſet.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I anſwer, when Cloſet-duties fit a man for thoſe other duties that lye next his hand, then doubtleſs he hath had Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in them: When private duties fit a man for publick duties, or when private duties fit a man for the duties of his place, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and condition, wherein God hath ſet him, then certainly he
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40722:240"/> hath had fellowſhip with God in <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 10.</note> them: When a man in Cloſet-duties finds more ſpiritual ſtrength and power to perform the duties that are next incumbent upon him, then aſſuredly he hath met with God; when private prayer fits me more for family-prayer, or publick prayer, then I may ſafely conclude that God hath drawn neer to my ſoul in private prayer; or when one Cloſet-duty fits me for another Cloſet-duty, as when praying fits me for reading, or reading for praying; or when the more external duties in my Cloſet, <hi>viz.</hi> reading or praying, fits me for thoſe more ſpiritual and internal duties, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelf-examination, holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſoul-humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I may reſt ſatisfied that there hath been ſome choice intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and my ſoul: When the more I pray in my Cloſet, the more fit I am to pray in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; and the more I read in my Cloſet, the more fit I am to read in my Cloſet; and the more I
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40722:240"/> meditate in my cloſet, the more fit I am to meditate in my cloſet; &amp; the more I ſearch and examine my heart in my Cloſet, the more fit I am to ſearch and examine my heart in my Cloſet; and the more I humble and abaſe my ſoul in my cloſet, the more fit I am to humble &amp; abaſe my ſoul in my cloſet; then I may be confident that I have had communion with God in my Cloſet.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I anſwer, That all private communion with God is very ſoul-humbling and ſoul-aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a man that had much private communion with God, and a man that was very vile and low in his own eyes, <hi>Gen</hi> 18. 27. <hi>And Abraham anſwered and ſaid, Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> In reſpect of my original (ſaith <hi>Abraham) I am but baſe duſt and aſhes;</hi> and in reſpect of my deſerts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deſerve to be burnt to aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. There are none ſo humble, as they that have neereſt communion with God. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a man that <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 10,—18.</note>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40722:241"/> had much private communion <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 24, to 31.</note> with God, and a man that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little in his own eyes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant;</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>I am leſs than</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 38,—41.</note> 
               <hi>all thy mercies.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> had to deal with <hi>Laban</hi> he pleads his merit, but when he hath to do with God he debaſeth himſelf below the leaſt of his mercies. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man that had much private communion with God (as I have formerly evidenced) and a man that was the meekeſt and humbleſt perſon in all the world, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> writing of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith (if he may be believed) <hi>that he was ſo free from paſſions, that he knew no ſuch thing in his own ſoul; he only knew paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by their names, and ſaw them in others, but felt them not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And ſo, when the glory of God appeared to him, he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40722:241"/> his face, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 22. in token of humility and ſelf-abaſing. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a man that had much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate communion with God, as is granted on all hands, and how greatly doth he debaſe himſelf, and vilifie himſelf! 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 20. <hi>The King of Iſrael is come out to ſeek a flea;</hi> and what more weak and contemptible than a flea? So <hi>Chap.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">As <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> ſaid of <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> He was high in worth, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in heart.</note> 24. 14. <hi>After whom is the King of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el come out? after whom doſt thou purſue? after a dead dog, after a flea?</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>'Tis not worth the while, the labour, 'tis below the Dignity and Honour of the King of Iſrael to take ſuch pains and to purſue ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſuch a poor nothing as I am, who hath no more ſtrength nor power to bite or hurt, than a dead dog, or a poor flea hath.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 226. <hi>But I am a worm and no man.</hi> Now what is more weak? what leſs regarded? what more deſpicable? what more trampled under-foot, than a poor worm? The Hebrew word <hi>Tolag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath</hi> that is here rendred worm, ſignifies very little worm, ſuch as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40722:242"/> breed in Scarlet, which are ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that a man can ſcarcely ſee them, or perceive them. Thus you ſee that holy <hi>David</hi> debaſeth himſelf below a worm, yea, below the leaſt of worms. No man ſets ſo low a value upon himſelf, as he doth, who hath moſt private communion with God. The four and twenty Elders caſt down their crowns at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 10, 11. Their Crowns note all their inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dignities, excellencies and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſtin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once asked, what was the firſt grace, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, humility; what the ſecond, humility; what the third, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> glories; and the caſting down of their Crowns, notes their great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſelf-debaſement. When Chriſtians in their Cloſets, and out of their Cloſets, can caſt down their crowns, their duties; their ſervices, their graces, their enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their enjoyments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſit down debaſing and leſſening of themſelves, then certainly they have had a very neer and ſweet communion with God.</p>
            <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40722:242"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath a remarkable ſaying of Humility, <hi>Suppoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a man were defiled with all manner of ſin and enormity, yet hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and another man enriched with gifts, graces, and duties, yet proud, the humble ſinner were in a ſafer condition than this proud Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen a man can come off from Cloſet-duties, and ſay as <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> once ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Non ſum dignus dici minimus, I am not worthy to be called the leaſt;</hi> then certainly he hath had fellowſhip with God in them. All the Communion that the creature hath with God in his Cloſet is very ſoul-humbling and ſoul-abaſing. In all a mans communion with God, ſome beams, ſome rayes of the glory and majeſty of God will ſhine forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul. Now all divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations are very humbling and abaſing, as you may cleerly ſee in thoſe two great inſtances of <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah, Job</hi> 42. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee: Wherefore I abhor my ſelf,</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:40722:243"/> 
               <hi>and repent in duſt and aſhes. Iſa.</hi> 6. 1, 5. <hi>In the year that King <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah died, I ſaw alſo the Lord ſitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the Temple: Then ſaid I, wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> What ſweet communion had <hi>Elias</hi> with God in the low cave!</p>
            <p>There was a Gentlewoman (of no ordinary quality or breeding) who being much troubled in mind, and ſadly deſerted by God, could not be drawn by her husband or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Chriſtian friends, either to hear or read any thing, that might work for her ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; at laſt, her husband by much importunity prevailed ſo far with her, that ſhe was willing he ſhould read one Chapter in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her; ſo he read that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. and when he came to the fifteenth verſ <hi>For thus ſaith the high &amp; lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place,</hi>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:40722:243"/> 
               <hi>with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> O ſayes ſhe, is it ſo, that God dwells with a contrite and humble ſpirit, then I am ſure he dwells with me, for my heart is broken into a thouſand pieces: O happy text and happy time, that ever I ſhould hear ſuch comfort! and ſhe was thereupon recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The more communion any man hath with God, the more humble and broken his heart will be.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>Bradford</hi> was a man that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi>
               </note> had much private communion with God, and he would many times ſubſcribe himſelf in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>John the hypocrite, and a very painted ſepulchre. Agur</hi> was one of the wiſeſt and holieſt men on the earth in his dayes, and he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 2.</note> himſelf for being more brutiſh than any man, and not having the underſtanding of a man. How ſweet is the ſmel of the lowly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olet (that hides his head) above
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40722:244"/> all the gaudy Tulips that be in your garden! The lowly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is the moſt amiable and the moſt lovely Chriſtian. VVhen a man can come out of his Cloſet, and cry out with <hi>Auguſtine, I hate that which I am, and love and deſire that which I am not: Oh wretched man that I am, in whom the Croſs of Chriſt hath not yet eaten out the poyſonous and bitter taſt of the firſt tree.</hi> Or as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>Lord, I ſee, and yet am blind; I will, and yet rebel; I hate, and yet I love; I follow, and yet I fall; I preſs forward, yet I faint; I wreſtle, yet I halt;</hi> then he may be confident that he hath had communion with God in his Cloſet. He that comes off from Cloſet-duties in a ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing way, and in laying of himſelf low at the foot of God, he certainly hath had communion with God; but when men come out of their Cloſets with their <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11, 12.</note> hearts ſwelled and lifted up, as the hearts of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they have had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: God hath not
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:40722:244"/> been neer to their ſouls, who ſay, ſtand by thy ſelf, come not neer to me, for I am holier than thou, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly and laſtly, VVhen a man finds ſuch a ſecret vertue and power running through his Cloſet-duties, as wounds and weakens his beloved corruption, as breaks the ſtrength and the power of his ſpecial ſin, as ſets his heart more fully, reſolutely, and conſtantly againſt his darling luſt, as ſtirs up a greater rage, and a more bitter hatred, and a more fierce indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Toad in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then certainly he hath had communion with God in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-duties. Conſult theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>In that day, a man ſhall caſt his Idols of Silver, and his Idols of Gold, which they have made, each one for himſelf to worſhip, to the Moles and to the Bats.</hi> In the day wherein God ſhould take theſe poor hearts <note place="margin">verſ. 3.</note> into communion with himſelf, their hearts ſhould be filled with ſuch rage and indignation againſt
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40722:245"/> their moſt delectable and deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Idols, that they ſhould take not only thoſe made of trees and ſtones, but even their moſt precious and coſtly Idols, thoſe that were made of Silver and Gold, and caſt them to the moles and to the bats, to note their horrible hatred, and indignation againſt them. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was the darling ſin of the Jews; their hearts were ſo exceedingly affected and delighted with their Idols, that they did not care what they ſpent upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 6. <hi>They laviſh Gold out of the bag, and weigh Silver in the ballance, and hire a Goldſmith, and he maketh it a God; they fall down, yea, they worſhip.</hi> The word here uſed for <hi>laviſh,</hi> in the Hebrew ſignifies properly <hi>to waſt,</hi> or ſpend riotouſly; they ſet ſo light by their treaſure, that they cared not what they ſpent upon their Idols: God gave them Gold and Silver, as pledges of his favour and bounty, and they laviſh it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Idols, as if God had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be wicked: O but
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40722:245"/> when God ſhould come and take theſe poor wretches into a cloſe and neer communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then you ſhall find their wrath and rage to riſe againſt their Idols, as you may ſee in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, 21. Their communion with God is more than hinted; but mark, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy graven images of Silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of Gold; thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtrous cloath, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, get thee hence.</hi> None defile, deface, deteſt, and diſgrace their Idols, like thoſe that are taken into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. Fellowſhip with God will make a man caſt away, as a menſtrous cloath, thoſe very Idols, in which he hath moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and with which he hath been moſt pleaſed and enamoured. Idols were <hi>Ephraims</hi> boſom ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned</hi> (or glew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Hebrew hath it) <hi>to Idols: let him alone.</hi> O but when you find <hi>Ephraim</hi> taken into a cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, as you do in
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:40722:246"/> that <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4, 5, 6, 7. then you ſhall find another ſpirit upon him, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> I have had too much to do with them already, I will never have to do with them any more: O how doth my Soul deteſt and abhor them, and riſe up againſt them! O how do I now more loath and abominate them, than ever I have formerly loved them, or delighted in them! Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi> they ſo hated and abhorred Idols, that in the time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> they choſe rather to die, than ſuffer the <hi>Eagle,</hi> which was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial arms, to be ſet up in their Temple.</p>
            <p>Though Cloſet-duties are weak in themſelves, yet when a man hath Communion with God in them, then they prove exceeding powerful to the caſting down of ſtrong holds, and vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">

            <p>After <hi>Moſes</hi> had enjoyed four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes private communion with God in the Mount, how did his heart riſe, and his anger wax hot againſt the Molten Calf that his people had made! <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19, 20. <hi>And it came to paſs, as ſoon as he came nigh unto the Camp, that he ſaw the Calf and the dancing, and Moſes anger wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hot, and he caſt the Tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount: and he took the Calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, &amp; ſtrawed it upon the water, &amp; made the children of Iſrael drink of it. Moſes</hi> had never more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate fellowſhip with God than
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40722:247"/> now, and he never diſcovered ſo much holy zeal, anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſin as now. When a man comes off from the mount of Cloſet-duties with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hatred, anger, wrath, and indignation againſt boſom ſins, darling ſins, complexion ſins, that were once as dear to him as right hands, or right eyes, or as <hi>Dalilah</hi> was to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> or <hi>Herodias</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> then certainly he hath had communion with God in thoſe Duties. When a man finds his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſins, his <hi>Dalilahs</hi> (which like the Prince of Devils command all other ſins) to fall before his cloſet-duties, as <hi>Dagon</hi> fell before the Ark, or as <hi>Goliah</hi> fell before <hi>David,</hi> then aſſuredly he hath had fellowſhip with God in them. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of ſome Families that had privy marks on their Bodies, peculiar to thoſe of that Line. Certainly, there are no Families, no perſons, but have ſome ſin or ſins, ſome privy marks on their ſouls, that may in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40722:247"/> a peculiar way be called theirs. Now when in private duties they find the bent of their hearts, and the purpoſes, reſolutions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of their ſouls more raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inflamed, and ſet againſt theſe, they may ſafely and comfortably conclude, that they have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in them. O Sirs, there is no boſome ſin ſo ſweet or profitable, that is worth burning in hell for, or worth ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Heaven for; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all your private duties and ſervices, labour after that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in them, that may break the neck and heart of your moſt boſome ſins. When <hi>Darius</hi> fled before <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he might run the faſter out of danger, he threw away his Maſſie Crowne from his head. As ever you would be ſafe from eternal danger, throw away your golden and your ſilver Idols, throw away your boſome ſins, your darling luſts.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the Anſwers to that noble and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40722:248"/> Queſtion, that was laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>My Ninth Advice and Counſel is this, In all your Cloſet-Duties look that your ends be right, look <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſtus opera no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, non tam actibus quam fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus penſat.</hi> Zanch.</note> that the Glory of God be your ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end, the mark, the white, that you have in your eye. There is a great truth in that old ſaying, <hi>(Quod non actibus, ſed finibus penſantur officia)</hi> That duties are eſteemed not by their acts, but by their ends. Look as the ſhining Sun puts out the light of the fire; ſo the glory of God muſt conſume all other ends. There may be <hi>malum opus in bona materia,</hi> as in <hi>Johu</hi>'s zeal. Two things make a good Chriſtian, good actions, and good aims. And though a good aim doth not make a bad action good (as in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah)</hi> yet a bad aim makes a good action bad (as in <hi>Jehu)</hi> whoſe Juſtice was approved, but his Policy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. God writes a nothing upon all thoſe ſervices, wherein mens ends are not right, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 23. <hi>They obeyed not thy voyce, neither walked in</hi>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:40722:248"/> 
               <hi>thy Law, they have done nothing of all that thou haſt commanded them to do.</hi> So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>All this evill is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our God.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> were very much in religious Duties and Services; witneſs <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 5, 6. I might produce a hundred more witneſſes to confirm it, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but becauſe they did not aim at the Glory of God in what they did, therefore the Lord writes a nothing upon all their Duties and Services. It was <hi>Ephraims</hi> folly, that he brought forth fruit unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 1.</note> And it was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, that in all their duties and <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> ſervices they lookt at the praiſe of men: <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you have your reward;</hi> a poor, a pitiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward indeed. Such men ſhall be ſure to fall ſhort of divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of a glorious recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that are not able to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the praiſes of men. Woe to that man, that with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is ambitious to go off the Stage (of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40722:249"/> Duty) with a plaudite. <hi>Peter</hi> was <note place="margin">See more of this in my Treatiſe on Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, page 157, to p. 168.</note> not himſelf when he denyed his Lord, and curſed himſelf to get credit amongſt a curſed crew. As ever you would ask &amp; have, ſpeak and ſpeed, ſeek and find, look that the glory of the Lord be engraven upon all your cloſet-duties. He ſhall be ſure to ſpeed beſt, whoſe heart is ſet moſt upon glorifying of God in all his ſecret retirements. When God Crowns us, he doth but Crown his own gifts in us; and when we give God the Glory of all we do, we do but give him the glory that is due unto his Name, for 'tis he, and he alone, that works all our works in us and for us. All Cloſet Duties are good or bad, as the mark is at which the ſoul aims. He that makes God the object of Cloſet Prayer, but not the end of Cloſet Prayer, doth but loſe his Prayer, and take pains to undoe himſelf. God will be <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Nemo;</hi> he will be All in All, or he will be nothing at all. Such prayers never reach the Ear of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40722:249"/> God, nor delight the heart of God, nor ſhall ever be lodg'd in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of God, that are not directed to the glory of God. The end muſt be as noble as the means, or elſe a man may be undone after all his doings. A mans moſt glorious actions will at laſt be found to be but glorious ſins, if he hath made himſelf, and not the glory of God, the end of thoſe actions.</p>
            <p>My Tenth Advice and Counſel is this, Be ſure that you offer all your Cloſet Prayers in Chriſts Name, and in his alone, <hi>John</hi> 14. 13, 14. <hi>And whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified in the ſon. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</hi> John 15. 16. <hi>That whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you.</hi> John 16. 23, 24, 26. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ye ſhall ask the father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full. At that day ye ſhall ask in my name:</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:40722:250"/> 
               <hi>and I ſay unto you, that I will pray the father for you.</hi> O Sirs, this is your Priviledg as well as your comfort, that you never deal with God but by a Mediator. When you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God, Jeſus Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with you, and he appears for you; when you do <hi>invocare,</hi> then he doth <hi>advocare;</hi> when you put up your petitions, then he doth make interceſſion for you. Chriſt gives you a commiſſion to put his name upon all your requeſts; and whatſoever prayer comes up with this name upon it, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it an anſwer. In the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency man might worſhip God without a Mediator; but ſince ſin hath made ſo wide a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no worſhip from man, but what is offered up by the hand of a Mediator: Now this Mediator is Chriſt alone, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God &amp; men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> One Mediator, not of Redemption only (as the Papiſts grant) but of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40722:250"/> Interceſſion alſo, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts make Saints and Angels co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mediators with Chriſt; but in this, as in other things, they fight againſt cleer Scripture-light. The Apoſtle plainly tells us, that the Office of Interceſſion pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Chriſt, as part of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation: <note place="margin">Heb. 7 25.</note> And 'tis certain, that we need no other Maſter of requeſts in Heaven, but the man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; who being ſo neer to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo dear to the Father, and ſo much in with the Father, can doubtleſſe carry any thing with the Father, that makes for his glory, and our good. This was typified in the Law: The High Prieſt alone did enter into <note place="margin">Ex. 28. 29.</note> the Sanctuary, and carry the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, whil'ſt the people ſtood all without; this pointed out Chriſts Mediation. In that <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 13, 14. you read of two things. Firſt, of the cloud of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, that covered the Mercy-Seat.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40722:251" rendition="simple:additions"/> Secondly, Of the blood of the Bullock, that was ſprinkled before the Mercy-Seat: Now that blood typified Chriſt's ſatisfaction; and the Cloud of Incenſe his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>Some of the learned think, that Chriſt intercedes only by vertue of his merits; others, that 'tis done only with his mouth; I conjecture it may be done both wayes, the rather becauſe Chriſt hath a tongue (as alſo a whole body, but glorified) in Heaven; and is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that that mouth which plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much for us on earth, ſhould be altogether ſilent for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
            <p>There is no coming to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">John 14. 6.</note> but by the Son. Chriſt is the true <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, by which we muſt aſcend to Heaven. <hi>Joſeph</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note> you know, commanded his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that as ever they looked for any good from him, or to ſee his face with joy, that they ſhould be ſure to bring their Brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> along with them. O Sirs,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40722:251"/> as ever you would be prevalent with God, as ever you would have ſweet, choice, and comfortable returns from Heaven to all your Cloſet-prayers, be ſure that you bring your Elder Brother, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the arms of your faith, be ſure that you treat and trade with God only in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>'Tis a notable ſpeech that <hi>Luther</hi> hath upon the 130. <hi>Pſalm. Often</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dulce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Chriſti.</note> 
               <hi>and willingly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do I inculcate this, that you ſhould ſhut your eyes, and your ears, and ſay, you know no God out of Chriſt, none but he that was in the lap of Mary, and ſucked her breaſts:</hi> He meanes, none out of him. When you go to Cloſet-prayer, look that you pray not in your own names, but in the name of Chriſt; and that you plead not in your own names, but in the name of Chriſt; and that you believe and hope not in your own names, but in the name of Chriſt; and that you look not to ſpeed in your own names, but in the name of Chriſt,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:40722:252"/> 
               <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>And whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Whatſoever we do, we are to do it by the authority of Chriſt, and through the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and in the name of Chriſt, and for the ſake and glory of Chriſt. Chriſt's name is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and powerful with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it will carry any ſuit, obtain any requeſt at his hands. Jeſus in the <hi>China</hi> Tongue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the riſing Sun. When a man writes the name of Jeſus upon his Cloſet-prayers, then he ſhall be ſure to ſpeed. though God will not give a man a drop, a ſip, a crum, a cruſt, for his own ſake; yet for Jeſus ſake he will give the beſt, the choyceſt, and the greateſt bleſſings that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven affords; that name is ſtill mighty and powerful, prevalent and precious before the Lord. The prayers that were offered up with the incenſe upon the Altar were pleaſing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. and came up with acceptance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren were kindly uſed for
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:40722:252"/> 
               <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſake. O Sirs, all our duties and ſervices are accepted of the Father, not for their own ſakes, nor for our ſakes, but for Chriſt's ſake. There are no prayers that are either hard, owned, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, regarded or rewarded, but ſuch as Chriſt puts his hand to. If Chriſt doth not mingle his blood with our ſacrifices,, our ſervices, they will be loſt, and never aſcend as incenſe before the Lord. No coyn is currant that hath not <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> ſtamp upon it; nor no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers goe currant in heaven, that have not the ſtamp of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. There is nothing more, pleaſing to our heavenly Father than to uſe the mediation of his Son. Such ſhall be ſure to find moſt favour, and to ſpeed beſt in the Court of Heaven, who ſtill preſent themſelves before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Chriſt in their armes. But,</p>
            <p>My eleventh and laſt advice and counſel is this, VVhen you come out of your cloſets, narrowly watch
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40722:253"/> what becomes of your private prayers; look at what door, in what way, and by what hand the Lord ſhall pleaſe to give you an anſwer to the ſecret deſires of your ſouls in a corner. It hath been the cuſtome of the people of God, to look after their prayers, to ſee what ſucceſſe they have had, to obſerve what entertainment they have found in heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>My voyce ſhalt thou hear in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O Lord; in the morning will I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> In the words you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things. Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in prayer. Secondly, His pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe after prayer. Firſt, His poſture in prayer, <hi>I will direct my prayer unto thee.</hi> Secondly, His practiſe after prayer, <hi>And I will look up.</hi> The Prophet, in theſe words, makes uſe of two military words: Firſt, he would not only pray, but martial up his prayers, he would put them it battel-aray, (ſo much the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Gnarach</hi> imports) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when he had done this,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:40722:253"/> then he would be as a ſpy, upon his VVatch-Tower, to ſee whether he prevailed, whether he got the day or no; and ſo much the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Tſaphah</hi> imports. When <hi>David</hi> had ſet his prayers, his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in rank and file, in good aray, then he was reſolved he would look abroad, he would look about him, to ſee at what door God would ſend in an anſwer of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He is either a fool, or a mad-man, he is either very weak, or very wicked, that prayes, and prayes, but never looks after his prayers; that ſhootes many an Arrow towards Heaven, but never minds where his Arrows a light. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints.</hi> If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would have God to hearken to his prayers, he muſt then hearken to what God will ſpeak; and upon this point it ſeemes he was fully reſolved. The Prophets prayer you have in the ſeaven firſt verſes of this Pſalm, and his gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40722:254"/> you have in the 8th verſe, <hi>I will hear what the God Lord will ſpeak.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Certainly, it will not be long before the Lord will give me a gracious anſwer, a ſeaſonable, and a ſuitable return to my preſent prayers. Pſal.</hi> 130. 1, 2, 5, 6. <hi>Out of the depths have I cryed unto thee, O Lord. Lord hear my voyce, let thine ears be attentive to the voyce of my ſupplications. I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My ſoul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning, I ſay, more than they that watch for the morning.</hi> Thoſe that watch abroad in dangerous times and tedious weather, look frequently after peep of day. How doth the weary Sentinel, that is wet with the rain of heaven or with the dew of the night, wait and watch, look and long; for the morning light. Now this was the frame and temper of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, when he came off from praying, he falls a waiting for a gracious anſwer. Shall the husbandman wait for the precious fruits of the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40722:254"/> earth? and ſhall the Merchant-man <note place="margin">James 5. 7, 8.</note> wait for the return of his ſhips? and ſhall the Wife wait for the return of her Husband that is gone a long journey? and ſhall not a Chriſtian wait for the return of his prayers. <hi>Noah</hi> patiently waited for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Dove to the Ark, with an Olive branch in his mouth: So muſt you patiently wait for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of your prayers. When chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhoot their Arrows, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind where they fall; but when prudent Archers ſhoot their Arrowes up into the aire, they ſtand and watch where they fall. You muſt deal by your prayers, as prudent Archers do by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſet me upon the Tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me.</hi> The Prophet in the former Chapter having been very earneſt in his expoſtulations, and very fervent in his ſupplications, he gets now upon his Watch-Tower, to ſee what becomes of his prayers; he ſtands as a ſentinel, and watches
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40722:255"/> as vigilantly, and as carefully, as a ſpy, a ſcout, earneſtly longing to hear and ſee the event, the iſſue, and ſucceſs of his prayers. That Chriſtian that in prayer hath one eye upon a divine precept, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a gracious promiſe, that Chriſtian will be ſure to look after his prayers. He that prayes and waits, and waits and prayes, ſhall <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> be ſure to ſpeed, he ſhall never fail of rich returns. He that can want as well as wait, and he that can be contented that God is glorified, though he be not gratified; he that dares not antedate Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but patiently wait for the accompliſhment of them, he may be confident that he ſhall have ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſuitable anſwers to all thoſe prayers that he hath poſted away to heaven. Though God ſeldome comes at our time, yet he never fails to come at his own time: <hi>He that ſhall come, will come,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and will not tarry.</hi> The mercies of God are not ſtyled the ſwift, but the ſure mercies of <hi>David.</hi> He
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40722:255"/> that makes as much Conſcience to <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 3.</note> look after his prayers, as to pray, he ſhall ſhortly clap his hands for joy, and cry out with that bleſſed <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Glover Acts &amp; mon.</hi>
               </note> Martyr, <hi>He is come, Auſtin, he is come, he is come.</hi> Certainly there is little worth in that mans heart, or in that mans prayers, who keeps up a trade of prayer, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looks what becomes of his prayers. When you are in your Cloſets marſhal your prayers, ſee that every prayer keeps his place and ground; and when you come out of your cloſets, then look up for an anſwer, only take heed that you be not too haſty and hot with God. Though mercy in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be yours, yet the time of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out is the Lords; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt wait, as well as pray.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and advice, for the better car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of Cloſet-prayer.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <p>I have now but one thing more to do, before I ſhut up this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

            <p>Firſt, As ever you would give up your ſelves to private prayer, Take heed of an idle and ſloathful ſpirit.

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40722:257"/> came to him for advice, how ſhe might reſiſt the temptation, and he gave her this anſwer, <hi>Never be idle, but be alwayes well employed, for in my own experience I have found it; when the Devil came to tempt me, I told him that I was not at leaſure to hearken to his temptations, and by this means I reſiſted all his aſſaults.</hi> Idleneſs is the hour of temptation, and an idle perſon is the Devils Tennis-Ball, toſſed by him at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that labours</hi> (ſaid the old Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite) <hi>is tempted but by one Devil, but he that is idle is aſſaulted by all. Cupid</hi> complained, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faſten upon the <hi>Muſes,</hi> becauſe he could never find them idle. The Fowler bends his bow and ſpreads his net for Birds when they are ſet, not when they are upon the wing: So Satan ſhoots his moſt fiery darts at men, when they are moſt idle and ſloathful: And this the <hi>Sodomites</hi> found by woful experience, when God rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 49.</note> hell out of heaven upon them,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:40722:258"/> both for their idleneſs, and for thoſe other ſins of theirs, which their idleneſs did expoſe them to.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> that during the time of their wars with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> and other enemies in <hi>Africa,</hi> they knew not what vice meant; but no ſooner had they got the conqueſt, but through idleneſs they came to ruine. Idleneſs is a ſin, not only againſt the Law of Grace, but alſo againſt the light of nature. You cannot look any way but every creature checks and upbraids your idleneſs and ſloth; if you look up to the heavens, there you ſhall find all their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lights conſtant in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>The Sun rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run a race,</hi> the Winds <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 5.

The Ant is a very little creature, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laborious; nature hath put an inſtinct into her to be very buſie and active all the Summer; ſhe is early and late at it, and will not loſe an hour unleſs the weather hinder. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſends the Jews to ſchool to learn to wait, and obſerve of the <hi>Stork,</hi>

And let me ſend you to the buſie <hi>Bee,</hi> to learn activity and induſtry; though the <hi>Bee</hi> be little in bulk, yet 'tis great in ſervice; ſhe flyes far, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines the fields, hedges, trees, orchards, gardens, and loads her ſelf with honey and wax, and then returns to her Hive. Now how ſhould the activity of theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put the idle perſon to a bluſh. O Sirs, Man is that moſt noble creature, into whom God hath
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:40722:259"/> put principles of the greateſt activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as capable of the greateſt and higheſt enjoyments; and therefore idleneſs is a forgetting mans dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and a forſaking of that rank that God hath ſet him in, and a debaſing of himſelf below the leaſt and meaneſt creatures, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in their order obedientially ſerve the Law of their creation. Nay, if you look up to the bleſſed Angels above you, you ſhall ſtill find them active and ſerviceable; <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> And if you look down to the Angels of darkneſs below you, O how laborious and induſtrious are they, to deſtroy and <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> damne your precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls!</p>
            <p>For a cloſe remember, that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo great an evil, that it hath been condemned and ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the very worſt of men. Among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Idleneſs was a capital crime. Among the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> he that lent money to an
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40722:259"/> idle perſon was to loſe it. By <hi>Solons</hi> Law, idle perſons were to ſuffer death. And <hi>Seneca</hi> had rather be ſick than idle. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> called men to an account for their idle hours. Among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> idle perſons were delivered to the <hi>Carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex. Antonius Pius</hi> being Emperour, cauſed the roofs &amp; coverings of all ſuch houſes to be taken away, as were known to receive an idle peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, affirming, that nothing was <note place="margin">Capitolinus</note> more uncomely, or abſurd to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, than ſuch idle Caterpillars &amp; ſlow worms to have their food and nouriſhment from that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in the maintenance of which there was no ſupply from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry &amp; labour. All which ſhould ſteel us, &amp; arm us againſt ſloth and idleneſs. I have the longer inſiſted on this, becauſe there is not agreater hinderance to Cloſet-prayer than ſloth and idleneſs. Slothful and idle perſons commonly lye ſo long a bed, and ſpend ſo much precious time between the comb and the glaſs, and in eating, drinking, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:40722:260"/> &amp; trifling <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they can find no time for private prayer. Certainly ſuch as had rather go ſleeping to Hell, than ſweating to Heaven, will never care much for Cloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Secondly, Take heed of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much of your precious time about circumſtantials, about the little things of Religion, as <hi>mint, aniſe, and cummin,</hi> or in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23.</note> into the circumſtances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in ſtanding ſtoutly for this or that ceremony, and in the mean while neglect the ſtudying of the covenant of grace, or about en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what fruit that was that <hi>Adam</hi> eat in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the Authors of ſuch and ſuch books, whoſe names God in his infinite wiſdome hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or in enquiring what God
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40722:260"/> did before the world was made; when one asked <hi>Auſtin</hi> that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he anſwered, <hi>that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Hell for ſuch buſie Queſtioniſts as he was.</hi> It was a ſaying of <hi>Luther, From a vain-glorious Doctor, from a contentious Paſtor, and from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Queſtions, the good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Church.</hi> 'Tis one of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans great deſigns, to hinder men in the great and weighty duties of Religion, by buſying them moſt about the loweſt and leaſt matters of Religion. Satan is never better pleaſed, than when he ſees Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians puzzled and perplexed about <note place="margin">Col. 2. 21.</note> thoſe things in Religion that are of no great moment or import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Such as negotiate and trade in Religion more for a good name, than a good life, for a good report than a good Conſcience, for to humor others than to honour God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch will take no pleaſure in loſet-duties: Such as are more <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> buſied about ceremonies than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, about the form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the power, ſuch will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40722:261"/> make it their buſineſs to be <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> much with God in their Cloſets, as is evident in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees:</hi> Such as are more taken up with the outward dreſs and garb <note place="margin">Luke 11. 34. 40.</note> of Religion than they are with the ſpirit, power, and life of Religion, ſuch will never affect to drive a ſecret trade heaven-wards. There can't be a ſurer nor a greater chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of an hypocrite, than to make a great deal of ſtir about little things in Religion, and in the mean while neglect the great and main things in Religion. Such as theſe have all along in the Scripture diſcovered a ſtrangneſs, and a perfect careleſneſs, as to Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-duties. I never knew any man hot and zealous about circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, about the little things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that was ever famous for Cloſet-prayer. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of curioſity, and of ſpending too much of your precious time in ſearching into thoſe dark, abſtruce, miſterious, and hidden truths &amp; things of God and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40722:261"/> Religion, that lye moſt remote from the underſtanding of the beſt and wiſeſt of men. Curioſity is the ſpiritual adultery of the Soul. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity is a ſpiritual drunkenneſs: for look as the drunkard is never ſatisfied, unleſs he ſee the bottome of the cup, be it never ſo deep; ſo thoſe that are troubled with the itch of curioſity, will ſay they can never be ſatisfied, till they come to the bottome of the moſt deep and profound things of God; they love to pry into Gods ſecrets, and to ſcan the myſteries of Religion by their weak, ſhallow reaſon, and to be wiſe above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Curious ſearchers into the deep myſterious things of God will make all Gods depths to be ſhallows, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will be thought not able to fathom them by the ſhort line of their own reaſon. O that men would once learn to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly ignorant, where God would not have them knowing. O that men were once ſo humble, as to account it no diſparagement
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40722:262"/> to them, to acknowledge ſome depths in God, and in the bleſſed Scripture, which their ſhallow rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot fathom. They are only a company of fools in <hi>Folio,</hi> that affect to know more than God would have them. Did not <hi>Adams Tree of knowledge</hi> make him and his poſterity meer fools? He that goes to ſchool to his own reaſon, hath a fool for his ſchool-maſter. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to grow ſtark blind, is to be ſtill prying &amp; gazing upon the body of the Sun: So the ready way to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <note place="margin">Deut. 29. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> blindneſs, is to be ſtill pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the moſt ſecret and hidden things of God. Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who by prying long into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20.</note> of nature, are become arch-enemies to the grace of God? O that we were wiſe to admire thoſe deep myſteries which we cannot underſtand, and to adore thoſe depths and counſels which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach. O let us check our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the things of God, and ſit <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33</note> down ſatisfied and contented to reſolve many of Gods actions into
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40722:262"/> ſome hidden cauſes which lye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of his eternal knowledge and infallible will.

Curioſity is one of Satans moſt dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, by which he keeps many ſouls out of their Cloſets, yea, out of Heaven: when many a poor ſoul begins in good earneſt to look towards heaven, and to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Cloſet-duties, then Satan begins to beſtir himſelf, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with all his might, ſo to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the poor ſoul with vain enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and curious ſpeculations, and unprofitable curioſities, that the ſoul hath no time for Cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Ah how well might it have
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40722:263"/> been with many a man, had he but ſpent one quarter of that time in cloſet-prayer, that he hath ſpent in curious enquiries after things, that have not been fundamental to his happineſs!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Prieſts affected curioſity, they had their <hi>Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> and ſtrange canting expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their imaginary unacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Deities, to amaze and amuſe their blind ſuperſtitious followers, and thereby to hold up their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> and apiſh Idolatries in greater veneration. O that there were none of this heatheniſh ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many in theſe dayes, who have their faces toward heaven. Ah how many are there that buſie themſelves more in ſearching after the reaſons of the irrecoverableneſs of mans fall, than they do to recover themſelves out of their fallen eſtate. Ah how many are there that buſie themſelves more about the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Angels, than they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſecuring their intereſt in Chriſt! And what a deal of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

               <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> deſcribes the Hierarchy of Angels as exactly as if he had dwelt amongſt them; he ſaith there are nine orders of them, which he grounds upon nine words, which are found partly in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and partly in the New, as <hi>Seraphims, Cherubims, Thrones, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Hoaſts, Dominions, Principalities, Arch-Angels</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and at large he deſcribes their ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, diſtinctions, and properties, as, that the firſt three orders are for immediate attendance on the Almighty; and the next three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the general government of the creatures; and the laſt three orders for the particular good of Gods Elect: That the <hi>Arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> ſurpaſs the beauty of <hi>Angels</hi> ten times, <hi>Principalities</hi> ſurpaſs the <hi>Arch-Angels</hi> twenty times, and that <hi>Powers</hi> ſurpaſs the <hi>Principalities</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Platonicks</hi> were the firſt that divided the <hi>Angels</hi> into three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as, ſome above Heaven, called <hi>Supercaeleſtes;</hi> others in Heaven, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caeleſtes;</hi> and others under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, called <hi>Subcaeleſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Firſt, They above Heaven (I mean this viſible heaven) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtand before God (as they ſay) praiſing, and lauding, and magnifying of his name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They in Heaven are there ſeated to move and rule, and govern the Stars.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They under Heaven, are ſome to rule Kingdomes, others Provinces, others Cities, others particular Men.</p>
            <p>Several Chriſtian writers that have written of the Hierarchy of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40722:264"/> 
               <hi>Angels,</hi> follow theſe opinions. Now if we ſhould take theſe ſurmiſes for real truths, then it will follow, that the higheſt <hi>Angels</hi> do not miniſter to the Saints, but only and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to God himſelf, which is <note place="margin">Jude 9. v. Luke 1. 19, 26. Zech. 4. 10. Rev. 5. 6. Heb. 1. 14.</note> expreſly contrary to ſeveral Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as you may ſee by them in the Margent among others. When I was upon the Miniſtration of the bleſſed <hi>Angels,</hi> I did then prove in ſeveral exerciſes (as ſome of you may remember) <hi>That all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, were commanded and commiſſionated by God, to be ſerviceable and uſeful to the heirs of Salvation. Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of Salvation?</hi> The Devil knows he is no loſer, and the curious ſoul but a very little gainer, if he can but perſwade him to ſpend moſt of his precious time in ſtudying and poring upon the moſt dark, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and hidden things of God. He that affects to read the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of John,</hi> more than his plain <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> or <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſies,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40722:265"/> more than <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, and is more buſie about reconciling diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Scriptures, than he is about mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of unruly luſts, or that is ſet more upon vain ſpeculations, than upon things that make moſt for edification, he is not the man that is cut out for Cloſet-prayer. Such as affect ſublime notions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure expreſſions, and are men of abſtracted conceits, are but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of wiſe fools, that will never take any delight to be with God in a corner. Had many men ſpent but half that time in ſecret prayer, that they have ſpent in ſeeking after the <hi>Phyloſophers Stone,</hi> how happy might they have been! O how holy, how happy, how heavenly, how hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how wiſe, how knowing, might many men have been, had they ſpent but half that time in Cloſet-prayer, that they have ſpent in ſearching after thoſe things that are hard to be underſtood! 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves in a crowd of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40722:265"/> worldly buſineſſes. Many have ſo much to do on earth that they have no time to look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As much earth puts out the fire, ſo much worldly buſineſs puts out the fire of heavenly affections. Look as the earth ſwallowed up <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> ſo much <note place="margin">Num. 22. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> worldly buſineſs ſwallows up ſo much precious time, that many men have no leaſure to be with God in their Cloſets; this buſineſs is to be done, and that buſineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be omitted, and t'other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion muſt be attended, ſo that I have no leaſure to ſtep out of my ſhop into my Cloſet, ſaith <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> the earthly minded man; thus a crowd of worldly buſineſſes crowds Cloſet-prayer quite out of doors. Many drive ſo great a trade in their ſhops, that their private trade to Heaven is quite laid by. There is nothing that hath kept men more from Chriſt and Cloſet-prayer, than the ſhop, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the Farm, and the Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, <note place="margin">Luke 14. 16.—22.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Stars which have
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:40722:266"/> leaſt circuit are neereſt the Pole; and men that are leaſt perplexed with worldly buſineſſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly neereſt to God, to Chriſt, to Heaven, and ſo the fitter for Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-prayer. 'Tis ſad when men graſp ſo much buſineſs, that they can have no leaſure for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in a corner. The noiſe is ſuch in a mill, as hinders all private intercourſe between man and man; and ſo a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of worldly buſineſſes make ſuch a noiſe, as that it hinders all private entercourſe between God and the ſoul. If a man of much buſineſs ſhould now and then ſlide into his Cloſet, yet his head and his heart will be ſo filled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with the thoughts of his employments, that God ſhall have little of him but his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or at moſt, but bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or at moſt, but bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> which profits little. If Chriſt blamed <hi>Martha</hi> for the multitude of her domeſtical employments, <note place="margin">Luke 10. 40, 41, 42.</note> though they were undertaken for the immediate ſervice and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40722:266"/> of himſelf, becauſe they hindred her in her ſoul-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Oh how will he one day blame all thoſe, who by running themſelves into a crowd of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſes, do cut themſelves off from all opportunities of pouring out their ſouls before him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take heed of ſecret ſins. There is no greater hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſecret prayer in all the world than ſecret ſins; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand upon your watch, and arme your ſelves with all your might againſt them.

There is no cloud, nor curtain, nor moment of darkneſs, that can ſtand betwixt the eyes of God and the wayes of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>The wayes of men are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all</hi>

Look as no boldneſs can exempt the Adulterer from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; ſo no ſecrecy can hide him from the eye of God. Though men labour to hide their wayes from others, and from themſelves, yet 'tis but labour in vain to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hide them from God. Men that labour to hide God from themſelves, can never hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from God.</p>
            <p>I have read that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Thais</hi> and <hi>Ephron,</hi> two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Strumpets, from uncleanneſs, only with this Argument, <hi>That God ſeeth all things in the dark, when the doors are faſt, the windows ſhut, and the curtains drawn. Heb.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; but all things are naked and opened</hi> (anotamized) <hi>even to the eyes of him, with whom we have to do:</hi> 'Tis an alluſion to the Prieſts

Though evil be done out of the eye of all the world, yet it is naked and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in his ſight with whom we have to do.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſins which lye cloſeſt, and are moſt ſecretly lurking in the heart, are as obvious and odious to God as thoſe that are moſt fairly written upon a mans forehead. God is <gap reason="foreign">

What is the Curtain, or the darkeſt night, or the double lock, or the ſecret Chamber, to him who cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves all things in a perfect nakedneſs. God hath an eye upon the moſt inward intentions of the heart, and the moſt ſubtile moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit. Thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were out, that held the eye and care of God deſcended no low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the heavens.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:40722:276"/> ſuddenly he roared out moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, crying for help, or elſe he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; and being demanded what he ailed, he half aſleep anſwered, <hi>That his friend Auſanius and his wife, whom he had ſlain long ago, ſummoned him to judgment before God:</hi> Upon which confeſſion he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and after due examination ſtoned to death: Thus the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and horrors of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences diſcover that ſecret wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which none could prove againſt him.</p>
            <p>I have read how that <hi>Mahomet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Turk Hiſt.</hi> Fol. 400.</note> the great <hi>Turk</hi> had with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards procured two Turks to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to kill <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> Theſe Traytors came to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſhew of the deteſtation both of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tyranical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and vain ſuperſtition, that they were both by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and others reputed to be indeed the men they deſired to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo after they had learned the Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they were both by their

            <p>Conſcience is Gods ſpy in the <note place="margin">Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> is the little conſiſtory of the ſoul. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is <hi>mille teſtes,</hi> a thouſand witneſſes, for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Court of Record, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſees it writes down; and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as quick in writing as the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can be in ſinning. The very Heathen could ſay, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was a God to every man.</note> boſome. Conſcience as a Scribe, a Regiſter, ſits in the Cloſet of your hearts with Pen in hand, and makes a Diurnal of all your ſecret wayes, and ſecret crimes, which are above the cognizance of men. Conſcience ſets down the time when, the place where, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, and the perſons with whom ſuch and ſuch ſecret wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes have been committed, and that ſo clear and evident, that go where you will, and do what you can, the characters of them ſhall never be cancelled or raſed out, till God appear in judgment. Let a man ſin in the cloſeſt retirement that humane policy can contrive;
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:40722:277"/> let him take all the wayes he can to hide his ſins, to cloak and cover his ſin as <hi>Adam</hi> did; yet Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſo play the Judge, that it will bring in the evidence, produce the Law, urge the penalty, and paſs the ſentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him. There is many a man who makes a fair profeſſion, and who hath a great name in the world, who yet is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſelf-condemned for thoſe ſecret ſins which are not obvious to the eyes of man, nor puniſhable by the Laws or hands of men; yea, many times in this life God raiſeth ſuch a hell of horror &amp; terror in many mens Conſciences, by reaſon of their ſecret ſins, that they can have no reſt nor quiet, neither at bed nor at board, neither lying down nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up; fain they would conceal their ſins, unwilling they are that the world ſhould know how vile they have been in ſecret; but Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being upon the rack, and ſtill a gnawing, accuſing, &amp; condemning of them, they can hold no longer;
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40722:277"/> now all muſt out; and now thoſe ſins that were moſt ſecret &amp; concealed come to be publiſhed upon the houſe-top.</p>
            <p>Some that have been under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Conſcience, others that have been ſmitten with a Frenſie, and many in their very ſleep have been often the blazers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers of their own ſecret filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs. In thoſe caſes God hath made many a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſinner to cry out with the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, unclean, unclean;</hi> and with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lev. 13. 45. Mat. 27. 4.</note> (before all preſent) <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I have ſinned.</hi> Many times in this life, God doth very ſtrangely and wonderfully diſcover thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret works of darkneſs, in which perſons have lived long undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Pythagorean</hi> bought a pair of Shooes upon truſt, the Shoomaker dies, he is glad, thinks them gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but a while after his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence flyes upon him, and becomes a continual chider and tormentor of him; he hereupon repairs to
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40722:278"/> the houſe of the dead, caſts in his money with theſe words, <hi>There, take thy due; thou liveſt to me, though dead to all beſides.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider, That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins are in ſome reſpects more dangerous than open ſins. Many a man bleeds to death inwardly, and no man perceives it. The more inward and ſecret the diſeaſe is, the more the man is in danger to loſe his life. There are no Fevers ſo dangerous, as thoſe that prey upon the ſpirits and inward parts; ſo there are no ſins ſo dangerous and pernicious to the ſouls of men, as thoſe that are moſt inward and ſecret. ſecret ſins often reign in the ſouls of men moſt powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when leaſt apparently.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, That he that ſins ſecretly deprives himſelf of thoſe helps and remedies, which by a divine bleſſing might arm him againſt ſin, yea, make him victorious over ſin, to wit, the Prayers, Counſels, Reproofs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Encouragements of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:40722:278"/> Friends, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A mans houſe may be on fire; but whileſt 'tis all inward help comes not in; but when the fire flames out, when it catcheth the outſide of the houſe, then help runs in, then help on all hands is ready. He that ſins in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret debars himſelf of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Remedy, and takes great pains to damn his ſoul in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to go to Hell in the dark. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Secret ſins will make way for publick ſins. He that makes no Conſcience of ſinning in the ſecret Chamber, will e're long with <hi>Abſolom</hi> be ready to ſpread a Tent upon the top of the <note place="margin">2 King. 16. 21, 22,</note> houſe, and to go in to his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such as have made no Conſcience of ſtealing a few pins or pence, or a few ſhillings in private, have in time come to be ſo bold, as to take a purſe on the road at high-noon. The <hi>Cockatrice</hi> muſt be cruſhed in the Egge, elſe it will ſoon become a Serpent. The very thought of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40722:279"/> ſin, if not thought on, will break forth into action, action into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, cuſtom into habit, and then both body and ſoul are irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt to all eternity.</p>
            <p>If Satan can but wound our heel (as the Poets feign of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les)</hi> he will make a hard ſhift but he will ſend death from the heel to the heart. If this ſubtile Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent can but wriggle in his tayl by an ill thought, he will ſoon get in his head by a worſe action. Hence it is that Chriſt calls hatred mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a wanton eye adultery. Secret hatred often iſſues in upon murder, and ſecret wanton glances of the eye do often iſſue in viſible adultery. If <hi>Ammon</hi> be ſick with the ſinful conceptions of inceſtuous luſt, how will his ſoul be in pain and travail till he hath brought forth! And how many are there that in ſecret have taken now and then but one Cup more than enough, who now may be ſeen at high-noon reeling againſt every Poſt. Look as ſecret diſeaſes in
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40722:279"/> the body (if not cured) will in time openly break forth; ſo ſecret ſins in the ſoul (if not pardoned and purged) will in time be openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Covetouſneſs was <hi>Judas</hi> his ſecret ſin; and no ſooner doth an occaſion, or a temptation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf, but he is very ready and forward to betray and ſell his Lord and Maſter, for thirty pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before all the world. <hi>Luſt having conceived brings forth ſin;</hi> and <note place="margin">James 1. 15.</note> that thus, Firſt, Sin hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that's delight; and then its formation, and that's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and then its birth, and that's action; and then its growth, and that's cuſtome; and then its end, and that's damnation. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Secret ſinning puts far more reſpect &amp; fear upon men than upon God. Thou wilt be unjuſt in ſecret, and wanton in ſecret, and unclean in ſecret, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in ſecret, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why? but becauſe thou art afraid that ſuch or ſuch men ſhould know it, or that ſuch and ſuch Friends ſhould
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40722:280"/> know it, or that ſuch and ſuch Relations ſhould know it: Ah poor wretch, art thou afraid of the eye of a man, of a man that ſhall <note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 12.</note> dye, and of the Son of man, which ſhall be made as Graſs? and yet not tremble under his eye, <hi>whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, ſharp and terrible, ſuch as pierce into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 14. Heb. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>parts?</hi> Ah how full of athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme is that mans heart, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly ſaith, <hi>If my ſins be but hid from the eyes of the world, I do not care though the Lord knows them, though the Lord ſtrictly obſerves them, though the Lord ſets a mark, a Memorandum up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> What is this, O Man, but to brave it out with God, and to tempt him, and provoke him to to his very face, <hi>who is Light, and in whom there is no darkneſs at all?</hi> Ah ſinner, ſinner, can man <note place="margin">1 John 1. 5, 6.</note> damn thee? can man diſ-inherit thee? can man fill thy Conſcience with horrors and terrors? can man make thy life a very Hell? can man bar the gates of Glory againſt thee? can man ſpeak thee
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40722:280"/> into the Grave by a word of his mouth? and after all, can man caſt thee into endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs torments? O no; can God do all this? O yes; why then doth not thy heart ſtand more in awe of the eye of the great God, than it doth of the eye of a poor, weak, mortal man.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the longer on this particular, becauſe there is not any one thing in all the world, that doth more hinder ſecret Communion with God, and ſecret prayer, than ſecret ſins. And Oh that you would all make it your great buſineſs, to watch againſt ſecret ſins, and to pray againſt ſecret ſins, and to mourn over ſecret ſins, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judge and condemn your ſelves for ſecret ſins, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Conſcientiouſly to ſhun and avoid all occaſions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that may be as fuel to ſecret ſins.</p>
            <p>Certainly there are no men or women that are ſo ſincere and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Cloſet-prayer, or, that are
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40722:281"/> ſo frequent, ſo fervent, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, in Cloſet-prayer, or, that are ſo delightful, ſo reſolulute, ſo undaunted, or ſo unwearied in Cloſet-prayer, as thoſe that keep themſelves moſt cleer and free from ſecret ſins.</p>
            <p>For a Cloſe remember this, That though ſecret ſins are in ſome reſpects more dangerous than other ſins are, yet in three reſpects they are not ſo bad nor ſo dangerous as other ſins are.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that they do not ſo ſcandalize Religion as open ſins do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that they do not ſhame, grieve, and wound, the hearts of the Saints, as open ſins do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that they are not ſo infectious to others, nor ſuch provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to others, to ſin againſt the Lord, as open ſins are. And thus you may ſee, what thoſe things are that you muſt carefully take heeed of, as ever you would adict your ſelves to Cloſet-prayer.</p>
            <pb n="451" facs="tcp:40722:281"/>
            <p> And as you muſt take heed of theſe five things: So there are ſeveral other things that you muſt carefully and conſcienciouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelves to, as ever you would be found faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in this great duty, <hi>viz.</hi> Cloſet-prayer.</p>
            <p>Now they are theſe;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Lament greatly, and mourn bitterly over the neglect of this choice Duty. He that doth not make Conſcience of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the neglect of this Duty, will never make Conſcience of performing this Duty. O that <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 1.</note> your heads were waters, and your eyes a Fountain of tears, that you might weep day and night, for the great neglect of Cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, He that mourns moſt for the neglect of this Duty, will be found moſt in the practiſe of this Duty. He that makes moſt Conſcience to accuſe, arraign, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himſelf for neglecting Cloſet-prayer, he will make moſt Conſcience of giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40722:282"/> up to Cloſet-prayer. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he turned his face towards the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and from his heart bitterly lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his great fall: O that you would turn your faces towards your Cloſets, and bitterly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your rare going into them. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Habituate your ſelves, accuſtom your ſelves, to Cloſet-prayer: Make private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your conſtant trade. Frequency begets familiarity, and familiarity confidence, we can go freely &amp; bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that friends houſe whom we often viſit. What we are habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, we do with eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. A man that is habituted or accuſtomed to write, to read, to ride, to run, or to play on this, or that muſical Inſtrument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he doth it all with delight and eaſe; and ſo a man that doth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate himſelf to Cloſet-prayer, he will manage it with delight and eaſe. But,</p>
            <pb n="453" facs="tcp:40722:282"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Keep a Diary of all <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 18, 19. Pſal. 66. 12.</note> your Cloſet-experiences; O care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully record and book down all your Cloſet-mercies: O be often in reading over your Cloſet-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and be often in meditating and in pondering upon your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-experiences. There is no way like this, to enflame your love to Cloſet-prayer, and to engage your hearts in this ſecret trade of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer.</p>
            <p>O remember that at ſuch a time, you went into your Cloſets with hard hearts, and dry eyes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you came out of your Cloſets, <note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 6. Pſal. 39. 12. Pſal. 56. 8.</note> ah how ſweetly, how evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, how powerfully were you melted, and humbled before the Lord! O remember how that at another time you went into your Cloſets clouded and benighted, but came out of your Cloſets with as glorious a ſhine of God upon your ſouls, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had upon his face, <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 28, 29.</note> when he came down from the Mount from communing with God! O remember how often
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40722:283"/> you have gone into your Cloſets <note place="margin">Luke 24. 31, 32. Iſa. 4. 4.</note> with cold, frozen ſpirits, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come out of your Cloſets what a fire hath God kindled in your ſouls, what a ſpirit of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have you found in your hearts! O remember how often you have gone into your Cloſets ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſhut up, but before you have come out, how hath your ſouls been like the Charriots of <hi>Aminnadab!</hi> O remember what <note place="margin">Can. 6. 12.</note> power God hath given you againſt corruptions in your Cloſets, and what ſtrenth God hath given you againſt temptations in your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets. O remember the ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of divine love that you have had when in your Cloſets: O remember the ſecret viſits, the ſecret kiſſes, the ſecret embraces, the ſecret whiſpers, the ſecret love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens that Chriſt hath given you in your Cloſets. O ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon theſe things, and then Cloſet-duties will be ſweet unto you.</p>
            <pb n="455" facs="tcp:40722:283"/>
            <p>'Twas a ſweet ſaying of <hi>Bernard, O Saint, knoweſt thou not that thy Husband Chriſt is baſhful, and will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Can. 7. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>not be familiar in company; retire thy ſelf by Meditation into thy Cloſet, or into the fields, and there thou ſhalt have Chriſt's embraces. Meditatio nutrix orationis, Meditation is the Nurſe of Prayer.</hi> O the more any man <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> meditates upon his Cloſet-experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the more he ſhall find his heart engaged to Cloſet-duties; the more you ponder upon Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-experiences, the ſweeter will Cloſet-experiences be to your ſouls; and the ſweeter Cloſet-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are to your ſouls, the more your ſouls will delight to be with God in your Cloſets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of one <hi>Meſſala Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> whoſe memory was ſo bad, that he forgot his own name. And I am afraid that many of your memories are ſo bad, that you forget your Cloſet-mercies, your Cloſet-experiences.</p>
            <p>I have read of ſuch a Peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſeaſe once at <hi>Athens,</hi> as took
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:40722:284"/> away the memories of thoſe that were infected with it, ſo that they forgat their own names: O that I had not cauſe to fear that ſome Peſtilential Diſeaſe or other, hath ſo taken away the memories of many that they have quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Cloſet-experiences. Well Friends remember this, though ſtony hearts are bad, yet Iron me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories are good; and O that you would all labour after Iron me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, that ſo you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ponder upon your Cloſet-experiences. I have read of the Heathens, how they made uſe of white and black ſtones, for theſe two ends, Firſt, They gave them to perſons at their arraignment before the Judges; if any were condemned to death, they gave him a black Stone, but if abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſet free, a white Stone! (To which cuſtome the Holy-Ghoſt ſeemes to allude, in that <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give a VVhite Stone.)</hi> A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond uſe of thoſe Stones was this,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40722:284"/> that by them they might keep an account of all the good dayes, or evil dayes they had met withal in their lives. Hence <hi>Giacopo Senzaro</hi> having been long in love, and much croſſed about his match, he filled a Pot full of black Stones, putting only one white Stone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and being asked the reaſon, anſwered, <hi>There will come one VVhite Day</hi> (meaning his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Day) <hi>which will make amends for all my Black Dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Friends, how often hath God given you the White Stone in your Cloſets! Certainly you have had more White Stones than Black Stones; your Cloſet-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and experiences have been more than your publick croſſes and miſeries. O Sirs, did you but reckon your good dayes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the White Stones you have had in your Cloſets, it would make you more in love with Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-prayer than ever. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be ſure that you do not ſpend ſo much of your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:40722:285"/> time in publick Duties and Ordinances, as that you can ſpare none for private Duties, for ſecret ſervices. Though <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Kine eat up one another, yet our <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 4.</note> Duties muſt not eat up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; publick Duties muſt not eat up family duties, nor family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties muſt not eat up publick du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor neither of them muſt not eat up Cloſet-duties: The wiſdom of a Chriſtian doth moſt eminently ſparkle &amp; ſhine, in giving every duty its proper time and place, I was going to ſay, that either he was <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 5.</note> no Chriſtian, or at leaſt no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chriſtian, that is all eye to read, or all ear to hear, or all tongue to ſpeak, or all knee to bow, to kneel, to pray. Ah how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there that ſpend ſo much time in hearing of this man and that, and in running up and down from meeting to meeting, that they have no time to meet with God in their Cloſets. O Sirs, your Duties are never ſo amiable and lovely, they are never ſo orient
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40722:285"/> and beautiful as when they are ſeaſonably and orderly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Oh how wiſe are the men of this world, ſo to order all their civil affairs, that no one buſineſs ſhall interferre with another; they ſet apart for each buſineſs a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proportion of time; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot an hour for one buſineſs, two for another, three for another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that we were as wiſe for our ſouls, as wiſe for eternity, as they are for this world. O that our hearts would ſo conſult with our heads, that we may never want a convenient time to ſeek God in a corner. That Devil that loves to ſet one man againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one Nation againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and one Chriſtian againſt another, that Devil loves to ſet one Ordinance againſt another, and one Duty againſt another: Hence tis that on the one hand he works ſome to cry up publick Prayers, in oppoſition to ſecret Prayer; and one the other hand
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40722:286"/> he works others to cry up private Duties in oppoſition to all publick Duties; whereas all Chriſtians ſtand oblieged by God, ſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage one ſort of Duties, as not to ſhut out another ſort of Duties. Every Chriſtian muſt find time and room for every Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon him. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Love Chriſt with a more enflamed love, O ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your love to Chriſt, and your love to Cloſet-duties. Lovers love <note place="margin">Can, 7. 10, 11, 12.</note> much to be alone, to be in a corner together. Certainly the more any man loves the Lord Jeſus, the more he will delight to be with Chriſt in a corner. There was a great deal of love between <hi>Jonathan</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 19. &amp; chap. 20. com.</note> and <hi>David,</hi> and according to their love, ſo was their private converſe, their ſecret communion one with another; they were alwayes beſt, when in the Field together, or when in a corner together or when behind the door together, or when lockt up together, and juſt ſo it would be with you, did you but
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40722:286"/> love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with a more raiſed, and a more enflamed love; you would be alwayes beſt when you were moſt with Chriſt in a corner.</p>
            <p>Divine Love is like a rod of Myrtle, which as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, makes the traveller that carries it in his hand ſo lively and cheerful, that he never faints or grows wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Ah Friends did you but love the Lord Jeſus with a more ſtrong, with a more raiſed love, you would never faint in Cloſet-duties, nor you would never grow weary of Cloſet-duties. Look as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> removed their Tents from <hi>Mithcah</hi> to <hi>Haſhmonah,</hi> from <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 23. 39.</note> to <hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> (as the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port): So the ſweetneſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love will make a man move ſwiftly on in a way of Cloſet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Divine Love will make all Cloſet-duties more eaſie to the Soul, and more pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to the Soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do all you can to ſtrengthen your love to Chriſt, and your love to Cloſet-work.</p>
            <pb n="462" facs="tcp:40722:287"/>
            <p> It was obſerved among the Primitive Chriſtians, that they were ſo full of love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they could be acquainted one with another as well in half an hour, as in half a year. O Sirs, If your hearts were but more full of love to Chriſt, and Cloſet-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you would quickly be better acquainted with them, you would quickly know, what ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, behind the door means. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Be highly, throughly, and fixedly reſolved in the ſtrength of Chriſt, to keep cloſe to cloſet-duties, in the face of all difficulties and diſcouragements that you may <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 17, 18, 19, 20</note> meet withal. A man of no reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or of weak reſolution, will be won with a Nut, and loſt with an Apple. Satan, and the world, and carnal relations, and your own hearts, will caſt in many things to diſcourage you, and take you off from Cloſet-prayer; but be ye nobly and firmly reſolved, to keep cloſe to your Cloſet, let
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40722:287"/> the World, the Fleſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, doe and ſay what they can. <hi>Daniel</hi> was a man of an invincible reſolution; rather than he would om it praying in his Chamber he would be caſt into the Den of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Of all the Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Satan is the moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to this of ſecret Prayer; partly becauſe Secret prayer ſpoiles him in his moſt ſecret deſigns, plots, and contrivances againſt the Soul; and partly becauſe ſecret prayer is ſo muſical and delightful to God; and partly becauſe ſecret prayer is of ſuch rare uſe and advantage to the Soul; and partly becauſe it layes not the ſoul of open to pride, vain glory, and worldly applauſe, as prayer in the Synagogue doth; and therefore he had rather that a man ſhould pray a thouſand times in the Synagogues, or in the corner of the ſtreets, or behind a Pillar, than that he ſhould pray once in his Cloſet, and therefore you had need to ſteel your hearts with holy courage and reſolution,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:40722:288"/> that what ever ſuggeſtions, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; oppoſitions, or objections you may encounter with, that yet you will keep cloſe to Cloſet-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>There is not any better Bulwark in the day or battel, than an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick reſolution of heart before the day of battel. Sanctified reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe exceedingly weaken and diſcourage Satan in his aſſaults, they doe greatly daunt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten him in all his undertakings againſt the Soul. That man will never long be quiet in his Cloſet, who is not ſtedfaſtly reſolved to ſeek the Lord in a corner, though all the powers of darkneſs, ſhould make head againſt him. O Sir, Divine fortitude, holy reſolutions, will make you like a Wall of Braſs, that no Arrows can pierce; they will make you like Armour of proof, that no ſhot can hurt; they will make you like that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 2.</note> that rolled away the Stone from before the door of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; they will either enable
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40722:288"/> you to remove the greateſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of oppoſition that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and Cloſet prayer, or elſe they will enable you to ſtep over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lather</hi> was a man of great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and a man that ſpent much time in Cloſet-prayer. And ſuch another was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who met with ſo much oppoſition, that had he not been ſteeled by a ſtrong and obſtinate reſolution, he could never have rebuilded the Temple, but would have ſunk in the midſt of his work: Now he was a man for private prayer, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. Who more reſolute than <hi>David?</hi> &amp; who more for ſecret prayer than <hi>David?</hi> the ſame I might ſay of <hi>Paul, Baſil,</hi> and many others, who have been famous in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>O Sirs, Sanctified Reſolutions for Cloſet-prayer, will chain you faſter to Cloſet-prayer, than ever <hi>Vliſſes</hi> his reſolutions did chain him to the maſt of the ſhip. 'Twas
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40722:289"/> a noble reſolution that kept <hi>Ruth</hi> cloſe to her mother, when her ſiſter <hi>Orpah</hi> only complements her, kiſſes her, and takes her leave of her. Be but nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 10,—20.</note> for Cloſet-prayer, and then you will keep cloſe to it, when others only court it, and take their leaves of it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Salentine</hi> Country, there is mention made of a Lake, that is ſtill brim full, if you put in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much it never runs over, if you draw out never ſo much it is ſtill full. The reſolution of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian for Cloſet-prayer, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. Hiſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 103.</note> ſhould be like this Lake, ſtill brim full: Tide life tide death, come honour or reproach, come loſs or gain, come liberty or bonds come what can come, the true bred Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt be fully and conſtantly reſolved to keep cloſe to his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Labour for a greater effuſion of the Holy Spirit, for the greater meaſure any man hath of the Spirit of God, the more
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:40722:289"/> that man will delight to be with God in ſecret, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>And I will pour upon the Houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and of ſupplications. verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>And the Land ſhall mourn, every family apart; the family of the Houſe of David apart, and their Wives apart; the family of the Houſe of Nathan apart, and their Wives apart: The family of the Houſe of Levi apart, and their Wives apart; the family of the Houſe of Shimei apart, and their VVives apart: All the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that remain, every family apart, and their VVives apart.</hi> Mark, in the <note place="margin">Joel 2. 28, 29. Iſa. 44 3.</note> laſt of the laſt dayes, when men ſhall be generally under a greater effuſion of the Holy Spirit than ever, then they ſhall be more giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to ſecret prayer than ever. There will never be ſuch praying apart, and ſuch mourning apart, as there will be when the Lord ſhall pour out moſt richly, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, abundantly, of his Spirit upon his poor people; now every one ſhall pour out his tears and
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:40722:290"/> his ſoul before God in a corner, to ſhew the ſoundneſs of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to ſhew their ſincerity by their ſecrecy; for <hi>Ille dolet vere, qui ſine teſte dolet, He grieves with a witneſs, that grieves without a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the more any man is now under the bleſſed pouring out of the Spirit of Chriſt, the more that man gives himſelf up to ſecret Communion with Chriſt. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is more or leſs with Chriſt in his Cloſet, as he is more or leſs under the anointings of the Spirit of Chriſt. The more any man hath of the Spirit of Chriſt, the more he loves Chriſt, and the more any man loves Chriſt, the more he delights to be with Chriſt alone: Lovers love to be alone. The more any man hath of the Spirit of Chriſt, the more his heart will be ſet to pleaſe Chriſt: Now nothing pleaſeth Chriſt more than the ſecret prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>(Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>O my D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The more any man hath of the Spirit of Chriſt, the more his heart will be ſet upon glorifying and exalting Chriſt: Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing glorifies Chriſt more, nor exalts him more, than ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and therefore the more any man hath of the Spirit of Chriſt, the more that man will be found in ſecret prayer.</p>
            <p>There are many perſons who ſay, they would be more in their Cloſets than they are, but that they meet with many hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, many occaſions, many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many temptations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppoſitions, many difficulties, many diſcouragements, which prevent them. Ah Friends, had you a greater meaſure of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit upon you, none of theſe things ſhould ever be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſecret trade Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40722:291"/> Had you a more rich anointing of the Spirit upon you, you would never plead, there is a Lyon in the way, a Lyon in the Streets; but were there a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 13.</note> Lyons between you and your Cloſets, you would either ſtep over them, or make your way through them, that ſo you might enjoy Communion with Chriſt in your Cloſets. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly and Laſtly, As ever you would keep cloſe to private prayer, Be frequent in the ſerious Conſideration of Eternity. O ſee Eternity ſtanding at the end of every Cloſet-Prayer, and this will make you pray to purpoſe in your Cloſets.</p>
            <p>O Sirs, every work you doe, is a ſtep to a bleſſed, or to a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eternity. Every motion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action in this life, is a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eternity. As every ſtep that a Traveller takes brings him forward to his journeys end: So every ſtep that a man takes in the ſecret wayes of Righteouſneſs and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:40722:291"/> Holineſs, ſuch as Cloſet-Duties are, they bring him neerer to his journeys end, they bring him neerer to a bleſſed Eternity. Look as every ſtep the ſinner takes in a way of wickedneſs brings him neerer to Hell; ſo every ſtep that a Saint takes in a way of Holineſs brings him neerer to Heaven. Look as every ſtep that a wicked man takes in the wayes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs brings him nearer to a curſed Eternity, ſo every ſtep that a godly man takes in a way of Righteouſneſs brings him neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a bleſſed Eternity.</p>
